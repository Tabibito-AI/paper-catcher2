METHODS: sPG I and II levels and PG I/II ratios were measured using both kits in 2,204 participants, including 1,109 controls, 316 GA, and 779 GC patients.
RESULTS: The GastroPanel- and L-TIA-derived sPG results showed high concordance. An sPG I concentration of 70 ng/mL and a PG I/II ratio of 3 measured with the L-TIA kit corresponded to 100 ng/mL and 5.3 with the GastroPanel kit. sPG I decreased in the GA and GC groups, whereas sPG II was lower in the GA group, but higher in the GC group than that in control group. The PG I/II ratios significantly decreased in the GA and GC groups, especially for the intestinal type. The sensitivity and specificity of PG I/II ratio ≤5.3 using the GastroPanel kit for the detection of GA or GC were 51%-59% and 61%-66%, respectively, which were slightly higher than 51%-58% and 58%-63% using the L-TIA kit. The group with a PG I/II ratio ≤5.3 and -negative status had the highest risk with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.36 for GA and 2.25 for GC, with more prominent increase in diffuse-type compared to intestinal-type.

However, there are no nationwide outcome data demonstrating its impact. This study aimed to identify patients with haemophilia A (PwHA) and observe trends in joint-related outcomes and life-threatening haemorrhages using national claims data.
METHODS: This serial cross-sectional study analysed claims data from the Health Insurance and Review Assessment in South Korea. PwHA treated with FVIII at least twice between 2007 and 2022 were identified. We observed joint procedures, life-threatening haemorrhages and comorbidities between 2008 and 2021.
RESULTS: The number of identified PwHAs was 1193 in 2008 and 1517 in 2021. The proportion of older adult patients has increased over the past 14 years. The joint procedure rates per 1000 patients were 61.2 (95% CI 48.0‒76.9) in 2008 and 17.1 (11.2‒25.1) in 2021. The rate was highest in patients with a severe phenotype. Annually, less than 2% of patients experienced life-threatening haemorrhages, with approximately 90% of the cases attributed to central nervous system and gastrointestinal bleeding. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes increased over the years (6% in 2008 and 15% in 2021, and 6% in 2008 and 9% in 2021, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed previously unreported long-term trends in haemophilia-related outcomes and comorbidities in Korean PwHA. Although the number of older adult patients has increased, joint-related complications have decreased over time. The trends, observed over 14 years, provide valuable insights for enhancing the treatment of PwHA."

The shift to outpatient postoperative care, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizes the need for effective management of postoperative outcomes. The high rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Korea necessitate focused transitional care during patient discharge periods. However, limited research exists on the postoperative experiences of discharged patients, underscoring the necessity of establishing evidence-based services to optimize transitional care.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to analyze the emotional experiences of patients who underwent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular surgeries using data from Naver, a major South Korean web portal.
METHODS: Posts were collected using specific keywords and processed with the Korean Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (KoBERT) model based on Transformer, which classified sentiments into positive, neutral, and negative categories. Model performance was validated according to precision, recall, F1-score, and support. Sentiment analysis was conducted within the Transitional Care Model (TCM) framework, divided into 5 domains: health status, care resources, care demand, interaction, and mental state.
RESULTS: The KoBERT model demonstrated high classification performance, achieving a precision of 96%, recall of 94%, and an F1-score of 94%. Sentiment analysis revealed that compared with cardiovascular surgery patients, cerebrovascular surgery patients experienced higher negative emotions regarding health status, whereas cardiovascular surgery patients expressed more negative sentiments in care demands.
CONCLUSIONS: Different patient groups experience distinct emotional and practical challenges postdischarge. Particularly, keywords within the TCM framework highlight that cerebrovascular surgery patients require robust rehabilitation and caregiver support, whereas cardiovascular surgery patients need better cost management. These findings underscore the importance of personalized transitional care strategies tailored for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The insights derived from this study can guide health care policymakers in designing more targeted and patient-centered interventions to improve postdischarge care and patient-centered transitional care, ensuring continuous and effective postoperative management."

Using more than 350 time-stamped SMV coat protein encoding gene sequences from more than a dozen countries and regions in Central Asia, East Asia, North America, South America, and Western Europe, we investigated the phylodynamics of SMV to understand the origin and dispersal of the virus via Bayesian phylogeographic inference.

Affected plants exhibited brown, irregular lesions (2 to 3 mm) on leaves and stems, leading to plant death. Small pieces (5 mm²) from the lesions of 10 affected samples were surface sterilized, plated on PDA with streptomycin sulphate (30 mg/liter), and incubated at 25°C for 5 days. After 3 days, fungal colonies were 3-4 cm in diameter, white to yellow-brown with a smooth texture, and gradually darkened to brown after 2 weeks. Conidiophores were irregularly branched, with one to five phialides. Chlamydospores were spherical, yellowish-brown in color, and measured 5.42 to 6.44 × 3.61 to 4.47 µm (n = 50) with a smooth, thick wall. Conidia were ellipsoidal to cylindrical, with truncate ends, formed chains, and measured 3.63 to 4.5 × 2.24 to 2.78 µm (n = 50), with a length/width ratio of 1.46 to 1.78. Identical fungal cultures were isolated from 7 of the 10 symptomatic plants, including two representative isolates (KACC49613, KACC410985) deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection. Based on morphological characteristics, the fungal isolates were identified as Paecilomyces formosus Urquhart (Samson et al., 2009; Sabernasab et al., 2019). For molecular identification, genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia, and PCR was performed to amplify the ITS region and beta-tubulin (TUB) gene with ITS1, ITS4, BT1A, and BT2B (White et al., 1990; Glass and Donaldson, 1995), respectively. Obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS: MW412748.1, PV436946.1; TUB: PQ659292.1, PV446603.1). A BLASTn search revealed 99.81% similarity for ITS and 99.1% for TUB to P. formosus CBS 990.73B in GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS and TUB sequences showed Korean isolate clustering with P. formosus sequences in a well-supported group, confirming its identity. Pathogenicity test was performed twice with two isolates (KACC49613 and KACC410985) separately by spraying 15 ml of a conidial suspension (2.8 × 104 conidia /ml) on 30 healthy A. hybridus plants, with five control potted plants sprayed with sterile water. All plants were kept at 80% relative humidity and 23 °C, with a 12-h photoperiod. Symptoms resembling to those observed in the field appeared after four weeks, while control plants remained asymptomatic. The pathogen was successfully re-isolated from symptomatic tissues, confirming Koch&#39;s postulates. This study is the first report of blight caused by P. formosus on A. hybridus in Korea, although this pathogen has been recorded to infect a broad range of host plants (Farr et. al. 2001). Field surveys suggest that P. formosus has potential as a biocontrol agent for managing this invasive weed. However, further studies are needed to evaluate its host range and potential risks to edible amaranths in Korea."

The initial symptoms appeared as brown spots and expanding grayish-white, desiccated lesions on the leaves. As the disease progressed, these lesions spread throughout the plant, resulting in wilting and defoliation. Diseased leaves were collected, cut into 3 × 3 mm2 pieces. The tissues were disinfected with 75% ethanol solution for 30 s, followed by 1% NaClO solution for 60 s, placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. A total of 28 purified fungal isolates were obtained from 30 samples. These fungal isolates showed similar morphological phenotypes. The three strains (QSHY8, QSHY10, and QSHY16) from different areas were selected for identification. The colonies were gray to dark green with abundant aerial mycelium on the surface. Conidia were obclavate or spheroidal, dark brown, with 2 to 3 transverse septa and 1 to 3 longitudinal septa, measuring 12.3 to 27.1 × 2.7 to 5.9 µm (n=100), with conical beak lengths ranging from 0 to 2.9 μm. Conidial chains exhibited a unbranched linear morphology, comprising 4 to 12 conidia (70.2 to 192.5 µm).These morphological characteristics were consistent with the genus Alternaria (Woudenberg et al. 2015). The rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor (tef1), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2) were amplified and submitted to GenBank with accession No. OR352571, OR352576, OR352577 (ITS), OR360378 to OR360380 (tef1), OR360381 to OR360383 (gapdh), PP054843 to PP054845 (rpb2). The isolates were identical to each other at each locus. BLASTn analysis of strain QSHY8 showed that ITS, gapdh, and rpb2 regions revealed 100% identity (503/503 bp, 557/557 bp, 951/951 bp) with Alternaria alternata strain (PV444769, MK903028, MK605900), and 99.57% identity with PV054872 (231/232 bp) for tef1. A phylogenetic tree of concatenated markers sequences (ITS, tef1, gapdh, and rpb2) and ex-type strains sequences was constructed using MEGA with the neighbor-joining method. The three strains formed a clade with the strains CBS121456 of Alternaria alternata, distinct from other Alternaria spp. Healthy potted plants were used for the pathogenicity test. Five leaves per plant were wounded at a single spot each with sterile needles to breach the cuticle. A 20 µl drop of 106 conidia ml-1 suspension was placed onto each wound, and sterile water served as blank controls. All plants were grown in pots in climate incubators maintained at 28°C and 90% relative humidity. 10 days post-inoculation, lesions consistent with those observed in the field were present on the inoculated plants, while no symptoms appeared on the mock-inoculated controls. Isolates recovered from the symptomatic plants were identified as A. alternata. based on morphological and ITS sequence analyses, fulfilling Koch&#39;s postulates.

However, there has so far not been an instrument to measure an individual&#39;s subjective financial well-being.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt the Korean version of the Personal Financial Wellness (PFW) scale.
METHODS: The Korean version of the PFW scale was evaluated with 2,044 adults who participated in an online survey in South Korea. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the factor structure of the PFW scale. Its validity was assessed by examining factor loadings, average variances extracted (AVE), and conceptual reliability (CR). In addition, the relationships between the PFW scale and the scales measuring theoretically relevant constructs were analyzed. Reliability was examined using Cronbach&#39;s alpha coefficient, the corrected item-to-total correlation, the inter-item correlation, and McDonald&#39;s omega.
RESULTS: The evaluation of the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the PFW scale indicates that it exhibits a single-factor structure, consistent with the English version. Factor loadings, AVE, and CR all exceeded the recommended thresholds. The model also demonstrated consistent fit indices regardless of the subsample. Invariance of both configural and factor loadings was established across gender, while invariance of configural, factor loadings, and intercepts was confirmed across regions. Additionally, the PFW scale, a subjective measure of financial well-being, is more strongly related to health-related variables than monthly income, which is an objective indicator of financial well-being. Internal consistency reliability for the Korean version of the PFW scale was found to be satisfactory.
CONCLUSIONS: The adaptation of the Korean version of the PFW scale provides a valuable instrument for researchers and practitioners in South Korea, where an instrument measuring an individual&#39;s subjective financial well-being does not exist."

METHODS: Data were collected from 257 adults in Korea aged 18 and over (157 men and 60 women), examining their level of alcohol use disorder and the usage of digital self-care devices (such as the number of days alcohol consumption was logged, continuous days of sobriety, feeling, alcohol cravings, alcohol probability, etc.).
RESULTS: The results confirmed that the severity of alcohol use disorder significantly decreased before and after the use of digital self-care devices, as analyzed by a t-test (M = 5.239, SD = 10.121, t = 6.945, df = 179, P = .000***). Additionally, a machine learning analysis (random forest) was conducted to explore the factors that most influence the reduction in alcohol risk levels among participants. The analysis revealed that the factor &quot;continuous days of sobriety&quot; had the most significant impact on the reduction of alcohol risk levels. The predictive accuracy of this factor was demonstrated using an ROC curve (AUC = 0.724). Subsequently, a multiple regression analysis was conducted to explore the factors influencing continuous days of sobriety. The results indicated that age and the logging of sobriety days had a significant impact, with the logging of sobriety days emerging as the most influential factor.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in reducing alcohol consumption and achieving successful sobriety, it may be more important to maintain continuous sobriety rather than the total number of sober days. Additionally, it is necessary to identify the key factors that help maintain continuous sobriety. Understanding which elements need to be fulfilled through digital self-care devices to sustain continuous sobriety is also essential.

Materials and Methods Incidence, survival, and prevalence rates of cancer were calculated using the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, from 1999 to 2019, with survival follow-up until December 31, 2020. Deaths from cancer were assessed using causes-of-death data obtained from Statistics Korea. Results In 2019, newly diagnosed cancer cases and deaths from cancer were reported as 254,718 (age-standardized rate [ASR], 275.4 per 100,000) and 81,203 (ASR, 72.2 per 100,000), respectively. For the first time, lung cancer (n=29,960) became the most frequent cancer in Korea, excluding thyroid cancer. The overall cancer incidence rates increased by 3.3% annually from 1999 to 2012, and decreased by 5.3% annually from 2012 to 2015, thereafter, followed by nonsignificant changes. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased again from 2016 (annual percentage change, 6.2%). Cancer mortality rates have been decreasing since 2002, with more rapid decline in recent years (annual decrease of 2.7% from 2002 to 2013; 3.3% from 2013 to 2019). The 5-year relative survival between 2015 and 2019 was 70.7%, which contributed to prevalent cases reaching over 2 million in 2019. Conclusion Cancer survival rates have improved over the past decades, but the number of newly diagnosed cancers is still increasing, with some cancers showing only marginal improvement in survival outcomes. As the number of cancer survivors increases, a comprehensive cancer control strategy should be implemented in line with the changing aspects of cancer statistics."
                        data-translated-abstract="Purpose The current study provides national cancer statistics and their secular trends in Korea, including incidence, mortality, survival, and prevalence in 2019. Materials and Methods Incidence, survival, and prevalence rates of cancer were calculated using the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, from 1999 to 2019, with survival follow-up until December 31, 2020. Deaths from cancer were assessed using causes-of-death data obtained from Statistics Korea. Results In 2019, newly diagnosed cancer cases and deaths from cancer were reported as 254,718 (age-standardized rate [ASR], 275.4 per 100,000) and 81,203 (ASR, 72.2 per 100,000), respectively. For the first time, lung cancer (n=29,960) became the most frequent cancer in Korea, excluding thyroid cancer. The overall cancer incidence rates increased by 3.3% annually from 1999 to 2012, and decreased by 5.3% annually from 2012 to 2015, thereafter, followed by nonsignificant changes. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased again from 2016 (annual percentage change, 6.2%). Cancer mortality rates have been decreasing since 2002, with more rapid decline in recent years (annual decrease of 2.7% from 2002 to 2013; 3.3% from 2013 to 2019). The 5-year relative survival between 2015 and 2019 was 70.7%, which contributed to prevalent cases reaching over 2 million in 2019. Conclusion Cancer survival rates have improved over the past decades, but the number of newly diagnosed cancers is still increasing, with some cancers showing only marginal improvement in survival outcomes. As the number of cancer survivors increases, a comprehensive cancer control strategy should be implemented in line with the changing aspects of cancer statistics."

from the known confirmed coronavirus 2019 cases can be imposed naturally in the
proposed Bayesian model. We also prove that the confidence interval of the
seroprevalence parameter based on the Rao&#39;s test can be the empty set, while
the Bayesian method renders a reasonable interval estimator. As of the $30$th

Materials and Methods The incidence, survival, and prevalence rates of cancer were evaluated using data from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database from 1999 to 2017 with follow-up until December 31, 2018. Deaths from cancer were assessed using cause-of-death data from 1983 to 2017, obtained from Statistics Korea. Crude and age-standardized rates (ASRs) for incidence, mortality, and prevalence, and 5-year relative survival rates were calculated and trend analysis was performed. Results In 2017, newly diagnosed cancer cases and deaths from cancer numbered 232,255 (ASR, 264.4 per 100,000) and 78,863 (ASR, 76.6 per 100,000), respectively. The overall cancer incidence rates increased annually by 3.5% from 1999 to 2011 and decreased by 2.7% annually thereafter. Cancer mortality rates have been decreasing since 2002, by 2.8% annually. The 5-year relative survival rate for all patients diagnosed with cancer between 2013 and 2017 was 70.4%, which contributed to a prevalence of approximately 1.87 million cases by the end of 2017. Conclusion The burden of cancer measured by incidence and mortality rates have improved in Korea, with the exception of a few particular cancers that are associated with increasing incidence or mortality rates. However, cancer prevalence is increasing rapidly, with the dramatic improvement in survival during the past several years. Comprehensive cancer control strategies and efforts should continue, based on the changes of cancer statistics."

Materials and Methods As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher&#39;s exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. Results Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p &lt; 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). Conclusion COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs."

the benefits from both water and liquid scintillator (LS) in a single detector
so that low energy physics and rare event searches can have higher
sensitivities due to the larger size detector with increased light yield. No
experiment has ever used a WbLS technology since it still needs some R&amp;D
studies, as currently being performed by THEIA group. If this technology works
successfully with kiloton scale detector at Yemilab then it can be applied to
future T2HKK (Hyper-K 2$^{nd}$ detector in Korea) to improve its physics
potentials especially in the low energy region."

                        data-abstract="This article discusses an experience of teaching Calculus classes for the
freshmen students enrolled at Sungkyunkwan University, one of the private
universities in South Korea. The teaching and learning approach is a balance
combination between the teacher-oriented traditional style of lecturing and
other activities that encourage students for active learning and classroom
participation. Based on the initial observation during several semesters, some
anecdotal evidences show that students&#39; learning is improved after implementing
this student-oriented active learning approach, albeit a longer period of time
is definitely needed to transform general students&#39; attitude from passive
learners to active ones."

of a knowledge base of socio-economic systems. The &#39;knowledge infrastructure&#39;
is measured using multiple indicators: webometric, scientometric, and
technometric. The paper employs this triangulation strategy to examine the
current state of the innovation systems of South Korea and the Netherlands.
These indicators are thereafter used for the evaluation of the systemness in
configurations of university-industry-government relations. South Korea is
becoming somewhat stronger than the Netherlands in terms of scientific and
technological outputs and in terms of the knowledge-based dynamics; South
Korea&#39;s portfolio is more traditional than that of the Netherlands. For
example, research and patenting in the biomedical sector is underdeveloped. In
terms of the Internet-economy, the Netherlands seem oriented towards global
trends more than South Korea; this may be due to the high component of services
in the Dutch economy."
