    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'Mothers’ duties and rights when positioned as remote education tutors in Australian distance schooling',
    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Public management of digitalization into the Spanish tourism services: a heterodox analysis',
    summary: "This study is a critical review of public intervention and its management of change with digitalization, applied to Spanish tourism services, as ones of the largest case and most required of attention into the European Union. In comparison with other mainstream papers, this heterodox review is based on the combination of Austrian Economics and Neo-Institutional approaches ( Cornucopists ), with their common theoretical and methodological frameworks. Thus, it is possible to analyze failures and paradoxes in the public intervention, especially with post-COVID recovery policies. The case of the Spanish tourism sector highlights the effect of double bureaucracy, from European institutions and the Spanish Government, affecting its competitiveness and revealing the confirmation of heterodox theorems. Faced with mainstream public intervention guidelines, which usually involve expansive spending and more debt (and New-Malthusian measures), a heterodox mainline solution is offered here, based on the revival of the original sustainability principle, the readjustment effect and the promotion of geek'n'talent education, to facilitate the transition to the Knowledge Economy, where the tourism sector is capable of offering personalized travel experiences due to digitalization.",

    title: 'In pursuit of equity in upper secondary education: the curious case of Ghana’s free senior high school policy',
    summary: 'The Free Senior High School policy is Ghana’s attempt at actualising the SDG 4 global consensus on free upper secondary education. Using grounded theory method, this research scrutinises the Free SHS 2018 policy and strategy document, alongside interviews with policymakers, to answer the question: How does the equity provision ensure fairness in upper secondary education, and what equity blind spots exist? Specifically, the study employed a purposive sampling technique, allowing for the deliberate selection of data sources that ensured the collection of focused, meaningful data aligned with the research goals. The findings underscore a disconnect between the policy’s equity intentions and solutions. For example, the policy highlights that, intersectional differences—such as economic, school-based, gender, and regional factors—persist and drive inequitable access. However, these issues are inadequately addressed because the policy applies cookie-cutter-style economic solutions to all inequity concerns. Policymakers from within, and outside from government, hold diverse perspectives on the impact of this disconnect on sub-populations. The former underscores political and technical accountabilities where increasing numbers of enrolment are equated to equity, while the latter underscores differential policy effect sizes on sub-population to mean inequity. Curiously, the policy has improved access despite the equity conundrum, weak economy, lack of private–public initiatives, declining GDP allocation to education, no selective fee waivers, and neglect of secondary education expansion prerequisites. The paper advocates realigning the policy’s equity dimension with its equity goals.',

    title: 'A phenomenological reading of integration in the longitudinal integrated clerkship',
    summary: 'This paper reports on a phenomenological reading of integration in education programs, through three layers of specificity: (1) broadly, on integration as an educational idea; (2) more particularly, on integration as expressed in the program model of the longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC); and (3) with the highest degree of specificity, on integration ‘at work’ in an actual LIC program. Each layer of penetration found different aspects of the phenomenological nature of integration. A further integrative leap across these aspects phenomenologically revealed four essential qualities of integration, being: integration transforms parts into wholes; integration’s animating locus is mutable, mobile and multiple; integration is already at work and is sustained through possibility; and integration holds open for ‘more’ integration. By appreciating integration for its essential qualities, this research adds foundational value to the literature on educational integration, and opens new questions about how we, as educators, might deliberately work with both its presence and its promise in our educational pedagogies, practices and programs.',

    title: 'The positioning of quality and expertise in initial teacher education: policy enactment in the Australian context',
    summary: 'Teacher quality and teacher education improvement have been central discourses for at least two decades in global education. In Australia, despite the pervasive nature of these discussions, there is a lack of substantial evidence indicating the existence of a problem in this regard. Policies aimed at enhancing the ‘preparedness’ of teacher graduates and elevating the ‘quality’ of ITE programs have nonetheless emerged as prevalent solutions over the past decade. The latest enactment of reforms in the policy chain is the Strong Beginnings report from the Teacher Education Expert Panel. In this paper, we align with Ball’s perspective that policy should be viewed as a dynamic process rather than a presumed, ready-made solution to a problem. We utilise systematic conceptual coding using Leximancer to enable a nuanced exploration of the understandings, practices, and conditions of influence for the policy actors inscribed in the TEEP report. We also analyse concept frequency and collocation in the final Strong Beginnings report, noting two main propositions: first, that there is a problem with quality in ITE; and second, that practice is foregrounded in professionalisation. We highlight the consistencies and contradictions within the discourses of the final report and the submissions from policy actors that contributed to this policy enactment process. We suggest that evidence is used when it suits a policy position, but ignored if it disrupts the platform position. We conclude by arguing that the policy actors in this policy enactment process should be afforded the professional authority to continue a well-established process of continual improvement.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    summary: 'In this paper, we suggest that poetic inquiry offers a pathway for capturing the deeply felt, personal dimensions of ongoing identity growth of initial teacher educators of professional experience. We propose that poetic inquiry provides an avenue for authentically sharing experiences and insights into caring and being cared for, diverging from conventional academic narratives. Through poetic self-reflection and collective poetic representation, we can uncover and navigate the subtle tensions shaping our identity journey, fostering a communal understanding of the teacher educator’s role within the contexts of Australian higher education and initial teacher education.',

    title: 'Studying Year 6 students’ perceptions of gender and their engagement in STEM within an Australian primary school',
    summary: 'Gender stereotypes—and performances of femininity and masculinity—play a key role in how and why an individual engages in STEM education. Students’ perceptions of STEM have been carefully and consistently studied in high school and in tertiary education contexts, but to date there has been limited research examining students’ gendered perceptions of STEM at the primary school level. This small case study adopts a critical feminist approach and draws on classroom observations and semi-structured focus group interviews using photo-elicitation to foreground student voice. The aim of this research is to uncover how Year 6 students (n = 6) living and learning in Australia perceive STEM as a gendered discipline of study. Drawing on an inductive thematic analysis, we identified key differences between boys and girls which arguably have implications for their engagement in STEM. Our analysis foregrounds the role of (1) self-efficacy; (2) social pressures and performativity; and (3) pervasive gender norms, which all played a role in influencing students’ identities. We then consider the implications of these findings for educators. The article concludes with an examination of the limitations of the study as well as considerations for future research.',

    title: 'Modelling the risk factors associated with female genital mutilation among the under-five children in Ethiopia, a retrospective study.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) also referred to as female genital cutting or female circumcision, has become a global health concern. It is a deeply entrenched traditional practice involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. To inform effective policymaking and raise awareness about FGM's health risks, understanding socioeconomic and demographic factors influencing the status of circumcision is crucial.\n" +
      "METHODS: The study employed logistic regression and maximum likelihood models to examine the association between mothers' educational level and the circumcision status of under five girls in Ethiopia. The data used in this study was extracted from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) report, which was conducted by the Central Statistical Agency (CSA).\n" +
      "RESULTS: The study found a strong association between mother's educational level and the risk of circumcision of under five girls. The girls whose mothers have no education or primary education have significantly higher odds of being circumcised with crude odds ratios of 7.69 (2.27-26.02) and 5.54 (1.64-18.65), respectively, compared to those whose mothers have secondary or higher education. Additionally, children whose mothers are Muslims (AOR: 1.98, 1.55-2.53), rural residence (AOR: 1.83, 1.21-2.78), and paternal education level (no education AOR: 2.03, 1.24-3.35) were also significant factors.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of maternal education, religious beliefs, and geographic location in influencing circumcision practices in Ethiopia. We recommend that more public education on the effect of FGM on the girl child will be enrolled especially in the rural communities in Ethiopia.',

    title: 'Navigating life transitions and mental wellbeing in the digital age: a call for stakeholders to embrace innovation and collaboration.',
    abstract: "Life transitions, such as adolescence, starting higher education or employment, and parenthood, are universally experienced yet psychologically demanding phases that can compromise mental health. While some transitions may promote positive growth, many transitions can also engender significant stress, which can potentially culminate in mental health difficulties and, in some unfortunate instances, psychopathology, especially when individuals lack adequate support. Traditional healthcare systems, already strained by increasing demands and limited resources, frequently offer inflexible, diagnostic-driven pathways with limited accessibility. Therefore, individuals, especially adolescents and emerging adults, have turned increasingly to non-traditional sources for mental health information and support. The internet, in particular, has become an indispensable resource for individuals seeking support around difficult life transitions, including the transition to adulthood. Multimedia content, especially videos, offers unique advantages: cultural sensitivity, peer-shared experiences, the ability to overcome language and literacy barriers and many more which are tailored to individual needs. Innovative content strategies, such as storytelling or expert interviews, can play a pivotal role in reducing the stigma associated with seeking mental health help during life transitions, which may, in turn, increase the likelihood for at-risk individuals to seek formal support if required, and can supplement traditional care with low-threshold information. However, the digital landscape is not without its inherent challenges, including misinformation. While there are frameworks to evaluate and promote credible, evidence-based health content online, there needs to be greater effort to ensure its frictionless integration into formal clinical pathways, when appropriate. To address the complex challenges and fully realize the benefits of digital media mental health care during life transitions, a coordinated, multi-stakeholder approach is essential: this includes collaboration between healthcare providers, policymakers, researchers, technology companies and content creators. We should prioritise developing culturally inclusive, engaging, evidence-based content; promoting digital literacy among users and providers; and expanding access to information, support, and self-management tools specifically designed for individuals navigating life's transitions. Investment in research and further advocacy for policies is necessary to ensure quality and sustainability of content as well as equitable access for a more resilient and mentally healthy society.",

    title: 'Mental health and loneliness in university students: A structural equation modelling comparing Italy and the UK.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: The transition to university often leads to increased demands and changes in lifestyle habits, which may affect mental health. In particular, loneliness could play a key role in the onset of psychological distress. Although many patterns are consistent across countries, cultural differences may influence students' mental health and feelings of loneliness.\n" +
      'AIMS: The aim of this study was thus to examine mental health domains and their relationship with loneliness among students from the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy) and the University of Surrey (United Kingdom).\n' +
      "METHOD: Data were from the CAMPUS study, a cross-national survey on students' mental health. A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was carried out to simultaneously test the pathways between loneliness and clinical domains in the two populations.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Anxiety and depressive symptoms were identified as the most common conditions in both the samples. However, Italian students were likely to show a higher degree of anxiety ( = 7.01,  < .001), while UK undergraduates greater depressive symptoms ( = -2.50,  = .013) and a higher prevalence of insomnia ( = -9.55,  < .001). Poor academic performance, along with limited social interactions were associated with worse psychological well-being, despite the likely influence of lifestyle differences among countries. Finally, a significant correlation between loneliness, anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as insomnia was found both in Italian and UK samples, as confirmed by multivariate analyses.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the existence of a cross-nationally, clinically meaningful psychological burden among university students, with a major role played by loneliness. Extensive promotion of healthy social networks, as well as interventions to support academic performance are needed.',

    title: 'Evaluating large language models as an educational tool for meningioma patients: patient and clinician perspectives.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The study explores the potential of ChatGPT, an advanced large language model (LLM) by OpenAI, in educating patients about meningioma, a common type of brain tumor. While ChatGPT has generated significant debate regarding its utility and ethics, its growing popularity suggests that patients may increasingly use such tools for medical information. The study specifically examines how patients who have undergone radiation therapy for meningioma perceive the information generated by ChatGPT, integrating both patient feedback and clinical assessment.\n' +
      "METHODS: Eight meningioma-related questions on diagnosis, treatment options, and radiation therapy were posed to ChatGPT 4. A questionnaire with these responses and feedback items was developed to assess utility, accuracy, clarity, and alignment with patients' experiences. Nine clinicians first rated each response's relevance, correctness, and completeness on a five-point Likert scale. Subsequently, 28 patients with meningioma completed the questionnaire during their first follow-up visit (three months post-radiation therapy). Finally, the same questions were presented to three other large language models (ChatGPT 4o mini, Gemini Free, Gemini Advanced), and seven blinded clinicians rated each model's responses before selecting the most accurate, eloquent, and comprehensive overall.\n" +
      'RESULTS: The study cohort included 28 meningioma patients, mostly female, with a median age of 60 years. Most patients found the information clear, accurate, and reflective of their experiences, with 60% willing to use ChatGPT for future inquiries. Clinicians rated the relevance and correctness of the information highly, although completeness was rated slightly lower, particularly for questions about specific radiation therapy details and side effects. ChatGPT 4 and its newer version ChatGPT 4o mini received the highest, nearly identical scores among the four LLMs evaluated, while Gemini Free scored the lowest in clinician assessments.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT demonstrates potential as a supplementary educational tool for meningioma patients, though some areas may require improvement, particularly in providing comprehensive information. The study highlights the potential for integrating AI in patient education, while also noting the need for clinical oversight to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n' +

    title: 'Description and Evaluation of a Co-design Process Involved in the Creation of a Workforce Training Package Aiding Sport and Exercise Professionals Work with Autistic Young People.',
    abstract: "Increasingly, researchers are encouraged to include consumers and stakeholders in the development of health and service provider education. This is particularly important for education relating to autistic people to ensure that resources are developed from a neurodiversity-affirming lens. Limited literature exists outlining or evaluating the processes used within co-design autism research. This study aimed to describe and qualitatively evaluate the co-design process used in the development of a training package for community sport and exercise professionals working with autistic young people. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the 10 consumers and stakeholders involved in this co-design project. Interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. From the transcripts, four themes emerged. In theme 1 members described characteristics relating to the co-design process they perceived enhanced their engagement. Members emphasised the importance of the project being consumer and stakeholder led, and flexible to support each person's needs. In theme 2 members described the connection they felt to the other group members, facilitated by the creation of an emotionally safe environment. In theme 3 members discussed how the processes put in place and the supportive environment created resulted in a holistic understanding of the skills and knowledge community sport and exercise professionals need to effectively work with young autistic people. In theme 4 members provided recommendations for future co-design research. Consumer and stakeholders involved in this project described an overall positive experience of the co-design process, with findings resulting in three key recommendations to support future autism co-design research.",

    abstract: "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds tuberculosis (TB) Centers of Excellence (COEs) that support TB control and prevention efforts in the United States. In 2018, the TB COEs conducted a multiphased assessment among U.S. staff involved in TB service delivery to identify needs related to TB training, resources, and medical consultation. Representatives from each TB COE and CDC's Division of TB Elimination formed a workgroup to guide the design of the needs assessment. The group used an online survey for data collection. Participants were staff working in some capacity on TB within the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Staff could be in non-public health (e.g., community health center, hospital, laboratory, private practice) or public health (state or local health department staff responsible for TB) settings and did not have to be a clinical health care provider (N = 1,482). We identified four priority areas for future TB training and education efforts. These areas include (1) focus on key topics; (2) tailor training and products to different professions, settings, and skill levels; (3) keep learners updated on the latest resources and best practices; and (4) use a mix of training methods and formats. The findings highlighted future priorities for TB training and education and were shared with health department TB programs throughout the United States.",

    title: 'Development and Utilisation of the Chinese Version of Professional Attitude Scale for Nurses: Two Cross-Sectional Studies.',
    abstract: 'AIM: To translate and assess the psychometric characteristics of the Chinese version of the Professional Attitude Scale for Nurses (PASN-C) and utilise it to investigate the present status and associated factors of professional attitude among Chinese nurses.\n' +
      "BACKGROUND: Assessing professional attitude is a crucial aspect of nursing professionalism. However, there is a significant gap in the field as no reliable instrument exists in China to assess nurses' professional attitudes.\n" +
      'METHODS: The PASN-C was created by adapting the Brislin translation model. The participants hailed from 11 hospitals in Tianjin, China. Two cross-sectional studies were performed, in which a convenience sampling method was used to survey 877 participants (first study) to assess the validity and reliability of the PASN-C; furthermore, 1154 participants (second study) were surveyed to analyse the current status and associated factors of the professional attitudes of Chinese nurses.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The PASN-C maintained 38 items and 8 factors, which explained 60.540% of the variance. The item-level content validity index (0.860-1.000), dimension-total score correlation coefficient (0.622-0.766), and Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.943) indicated PASN-C had good validity and reliability. The score of PASN-C was 136.16 ± 15.48. Male, tertiary hospitals, specialty hospitals, high-income, obstetric nurses and specialist nurses were associated with a higher professional attitude.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The PASN-C is a reliable and valid instrument that can be utilised to assess Chinese nurses' professional attitudes. Furthermore, this study suggests that more attention should be paid to associated factors to improve nurses' professional attitudes.\n" +
      "IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION: The PASN-C can be an effective tool to assess the professional attitude of Chinese nurses. Furthermore, nursing administrators, educators and clinical nursing practitioners could strengthen training in the dimensions of 'autonomy of clinical judgment', 'work-related independence' and 'enhancement of nursing education' to improve the professional attitude of nurses.\n" +

    title: "Residents' perceptions of the on-call experience and of the supervision of their clinical reasoning skills in the paediatric emergency department: A qualitative study.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: A substantial number of residents suffer from stress, anxiety, which may be acutely exacerbated by stressful situations such as being on call. When confronted with complex situations, uncertainty, a lack of medical experience, residents experience a mismatch between their theoretical knowledge and their clinical reasoning skills. In a previous study we observed high levels of cognitive weariness and anxiety in residents being on call in the paediatric emergency department, and the reduction of their cognitive weariness by training clinician-educators in the supervision of clinical reasoning.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVES: Thereafter we sought to inform the findings of our previous quantitative research by exploring in depth the experience of on-call residents in the paediatric emergency department, including: the factors that impact their well-being, and how supervision of their clinical reasoning might change it.\n' +
      'METHODS AND SETTING: We performed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. We interviewed medical residents who were on call in the paediatric emergency department, mentored by paediatricians who had received specific training in the supervision of clinical reasoning.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The findings revealed two opposing profiles of how residents experience being on call and having their clinical reasoning supervised. First, there were those who expressed marked discomfort, characterized by anxiety, a strong need for supervision, a fear of being judged by the supervisor, and a major impact of physical fatigue. Residents with this profile seem to be at risk of developing burnout, or symptoms thereof. The second profile of residents expressed little unease, had a sense of self-efficacy, a feeling of personal competence, a high level of self-confidence, greater tolerance of uncertainty, and little difficulty with making decisions.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Supervision of clinical reasoning based on questioning techniques seems to participate to promote development towards second profile, with greater tolerance of uncertainty, ease with decision-making, and a reinforced sense of belonging to a team.',
