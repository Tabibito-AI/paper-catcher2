    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'Optimization of Corporate Governance from the Perspectives of Law and Economics and Blockchain',
    summary: 'Blockchain’s spontaneous consensus mechanism, characterized by technologies of decentralization, immutability, high transparency, and codification, helps address agency costs and the formalization of shareholder meetings in traditional corporate governance. With the advancement of blockchain technology, the integration of legal rules and code rules in corporate governance has become the new norm. As per the transaction cost theory of law and economics and the Coase Theorem, blockchain has promoted changes in governance rules by markedly reducing agency costs within companies. Corporate governance will exhibit partial and gradual adjustments when blockchain technology substantially diminishes these costs but falls short of achieving the optimal state of zero transaction costs. These changes not only enhance the transparency and efficiency of corporate governance but also effectively curb the misconduct of controlling shareholders and protect the rights of minority shareholders.',

Topic modeling using BERTopic revealed that the experimental group's reflections focused more on strategy adjustment, logical reasoning, and conceptual understanding, whereas the control group's reflections were more descriptive and operational. These findings suggest that AI-supported structured feedback can enhance the quality of student reflections, increase learning engagement, and improve collaborative interactions. This study demonstrates the practical value and effectiveness of AI-assisted reflection within the 6E+R instructional model, offering new directions for reflective design in STEM collaborative learning and expanding the potential of generative AI in educational settings.",

    title: 'Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Integration in Regional Sports Education to Foster Equitable and Sustainable Development',
    summary: 'Objective: Regional disparities in sports education have become a critical issue in the education sector. Variances in sports education resources, educational levels, and participation exist among different regions, leading to disparities in students’ physical fitness, health conditions, and developmental opportunities. Method: This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to improve equity in regional sports education through literature review, expert interviews, and data analysis. Conclusion: The causes of this phenomenon primarily involve various factors such as differences in economic development levels, urban-rural disparities, regional differences, and ethnic disparities. Measures to address this issue include raising public awareness and demand for artificial intelligence technology, developing suitable solutions, enhancing teacher training, and establishing demonstration points and cooperative schools. The application of artificial intelligence technology in regional sports education involves balancing benefits and risks, including risks related to data privacy and security, technological reliability and effectiveness, education and teaching quality, regional and cultural differences, as well as legal and ethical risks. Recommendations: It is recommended to strengthen data privacy protection, improve technological reliability, emphasize teacher guidance and supervision, and establish clear legal and ethical guidelines when promoting the application of artificial intelligence technology in regional sports education. Additionally, diversification in development pathways should be established, encouraging participation and support from various sectors of society to collectively promote the reasonable application and development of artificial intelligence technology.',

    title: 'Non-Immersive Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) with XR Elements in Nursing Education: Learning Interaction and Clinical Competence',
    summary: 'The way nursing students acquire clinical competence and patient safety awareness has changed as a result of the adoption of virtual learning environments (VLEs) in healthcare education. Non-immersive VLEs that display virtual scenarios offer secure learning experiences. Easily accessible and reasonably priced non-immersive VLEs can safely enhance learning clinical procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no earlier research on non-immersive VLEs with extended reality (XR) elements in nursing education, and this research fills that gap. This study investigates nursing students’ expectations and experiences of using non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to learn interaction and clinical competence, such as infusion pump operations. It also explores the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the use of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements in this context. Fifteen first-year nursing students engaged in two non-immersive learning scenarios. The learning process was structured using a seven-phase simulation pedagogy. The data were collected using pre- and post-questionnaires; group discussions; and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings highlight the potential of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to enhance engagement, confidence, and competence acquisition in nursing students while complementing traditional hands-on training. The study highlights the importance of blended learning strategies that integrate technical and scenario-based approaches, as well as simulation pedagogy, to optimize knowledge retention and clinical competency development. As digital technologies continue to shape healthcare education, non-immersive VLEs with XR elements are valuable in bridging the gap between theory and practice, ultimately contributing to patient safety and improved healthcare outcomes.',

    title: 'The Effect of Overcoming the Digital Divide on Middle Frontal Gyrus Atrophy in Aging Adults: Large-Scale Retrospective Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cohort Study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The rapid integration of information technology into daily life has exacerbated the digital divide (DD), particularly among older adults, who often face barriers to technology adoption. Although prior research has linked technology use to cognitive benefits, the long-term neurostructural and cognitive consequences of the DD remain poorly understood.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use large-scale neuroimaging data to examine how the DD affects long-term brain structure and cognitive aging in older adults. It specifically investigates (1) structural and cognitive differences between older adults with and without DD engagement, (2) predictive relationships between group-distinctive brain regions and cognitive outcomes, and (3) longitudinal impacts of DD exposure on accelerated aging trajectories of neural substrates and cognitive functions.\n' +
      "METHODS: The study included 1280 community-dwelling older adults (aged 65-90 y) who completed comprehensive cognitive assessments and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline. Longitudinal data were available for 689 participants (mean follow-up 3.2 y). Participants were classified into the DD (n=640) and overcoming DD (n=640) groups using rigorous propensity score matching to control for age, education, gender, and baseline health conditions. A computational framework using the searchlight technique and cross-validation classification model investigated group differences in structural features and cognitive representation. The aging rate of each voxel's structural feature was calculated to explore the long-term influence of the DD.\n" +
      'RESULTS: The DD group showed significant deficits in executive function (t=4.75; P<.001; Cohen d=0.38) and processing speed (t=4.62; P<.001; Cohen d=0.37) compared to the overcoming DD group. Reduced gray matter volume in the DD group spanned the fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and superior temporal sulcus (false discovery rate-corrected P<.05). The computational framework identified the key structural substrates related to executive function and processing speed, excluding the ventro-orbitofrontal lobe (classification accuracy <0.6). Longitudinal findings highlighted the long-term impact of the DD. The DD group exhibited faster gray matter volume decline in the middle frontal gyrus (t=3.95 for the peak voxel in this cluster, false discovery rate-corrected P<.05), which mediated 17% of episodic memory decline (P=.02).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Older adults who overcome the DD demonstrate preserved gray matter structure and slower cognitive decline, particularly in frontotemporal regions critical for executive function. Our findings underscore that mobile digital interventions should be explored as potential cognitive decline prevention strategies.',

    title: 'Self-Reported Bruxism, Masticatory Muscle Pain, Psychological Profile and Bowel Symptoms: A Retrospective Study.',
    abstract: 'AIM: To investigate associations between self-reported bruxism, masticatory muscle pain and bowel symptoms, and their relationship to the 9 dimensions of the Symptom Checklist-90- Revised (SCL-90-R).\n' +
      'METHODS: Data from 3 separate validated questionnaires - Bowel Symptom Questionnaire (BSQ) to classify bowel status, Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) to determine self-reported bruxism and masticatory muscle pain on palpation, and SCL-90-R for psychometric assessment were collected for each patient. BSQ used the Rome II criteria to identify the presence or absence of bowel symptoms but did not analyse sub-sets of bowel symptoms. Chi-squared tests were used to test for pairwise associations between bruxism, masticatory muscle pain and bowel status. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictors of bruxism and bowel symptoms.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Data from 246 surveys were collected for self- reported bruxism, muscle pain and bowel status of which 191 patients completed the SCL- 90R. There was significant association between self-reported bruxism and muscle pain (p=0.004) and bowel symptoms (p=0.020). Bowel problems were identified in 53% patients and 48% patients presented with both self-reported bruxism and bowel problems. There was no significant association between bowel symptoms and muscle pain. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified 'muscle pain' and 'bowel symptoms' as independent predictors of self-reported bruxism, and 'somatization' as the sole independent predictor of bowel symptoms.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: These data establish a possible relationship between self-reporte bruxism and bowel symptoms, necessitating need for education and formulation of clinical practice guidelines for interdisciplinary care of this group of patients.',

    title: 'Supporting our survivors: an evaluation of the facilitators and barriers to advocacy in cervical and breast cancer survivors.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the facilitators and barriers to self-advocacy and advocacy in the community of cervical and breast cancer survivors.\n' +
      'METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used to collect data from patients with breast and cervical cancer. Qualitative interviews were conducted after presenting for routine oncologic follow-up appointments All interviews were transcribed and coded by two separate investigators. The Female Self-Advocacy in Cancer Survivorship Scale (FSACS) was administered and demographic data were collected to quantitatively evaluate self-advocacy behaviors and socioeconomic characteristics in the two groups.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were interviewed: 11 cervical cancer (CC) patients and 10 breast cancer (BC) patients. The median age was 47 years, with approximately half having early-stage disease and half having advanced or recurrent disease. The facilitators to self-advocacy included being open with their support system, wanting more information, and being determined to fight. Barriers to self-advocacy included fear, not opening up to family and friends, and not wanting additional information. Facilitators to advocacy in the community were talking with their children about their diagnosis, having an interest in support groups, and a desire to help. Barriers to community advocacy included not always feeling supported, a lack of confidence, and a lack of understanding of their disease process. CC participants scored lower on the FSACS survey compared to BC patients, with mean scores of 95 and 107, respectively.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Facilitators to advocacy involve having a strong social network and a determination to fight or desire to help. Barriers include fear, lack of confidence, and lack of knowledge. Increasing resources to encourage social connection, education, and advocacy opportunities can positively impact cancer survivors well-being.',

    title: 'Does universal healthcare coverage ensure equal access to contraception? Socioeconomic inequalities on contraceptive use in a young-adult population in Porto, Portugal.',
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Access to effective and safe contraception is important to women, individually, and to the population's health and well-being. Universal free access to family planning is provided in Portugal, yet it is unknown if socioeconomic inequalities remain in access and use of contraceptives.\n" +
      'PURPOSE: To study the association between socioeconomic status and use of contraceptives by young Portuguese women, and whether healthcare use contributes to socioeconomic inequalities.\n' +
      'MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed data from 552 young-adult women from the EPITeen cohort. We regressed use and method of contraception against individual net monthly income, education level, and the number of medical appointments in the past year.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Most women (84.1%) currently used contraceptives. Though, contraceptive use was less frequent among women with lower incomes [adjusted OR (aOR) = 0.340,  < 0.005] especially the vaginal ring or contraceptive patch (aOR = 0.164,  < 0.05). Women with lower education status were less likely to use contraceptives (aOR = 0.402,  < 0.05). The number of medical appointments in the last year was not associated with the use and method of contraception. Similar results were found for the ever use of contraceptives.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Despite universal health coverage policies in Portugal, contraceptive use is still socioeconomically patterned. To achieve their full potential, family planning programs and policies must be revised, ensuring equitable access for all.',

    title: 'Informed Consent for Ambient Documentation Using Generative AI in Ambulatory Care.',
    abstract: 'IMPORTANCE: Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted ambient documentation technologies that use audio from clinic visits to generate documentation are being deployed across hospital systems to optimize clinical note writing and reduce administrative burden. However, little is known about optimal approaches to engage patients in informed consent for these tools.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVES: To explore clinician and patient experiences with consent processes and examine the association between the use of ambient documentation tools and the patient-clinician relationship.\n' +
      'DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was conducted from March 1 to December 31, 2024, in ambulatory practices across specialties in a large urban academic health center as part of an ongoing operational quality improvement initiative. Participants included clinicians and patients participating in an operational proof-of-concept exploration of ambient documentation technology.\n' +
      'MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A pragmatic, sequential, inductive-deductive qualitative evaluation was conducted of informed consent contexts, processes, and challenges among ambulatory clinicians and patients exposed to ambient documentation technology. Evaluation included site visits, clinical observations, clinician interviews, and patient surveys to explore perceptions and challenges related to consent.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 121 ambient documentation pilot users included 18 clinicians (mean [SD] years of practice, 18.6 [100]; 10 men [55.6%]) and 103 patients (mean [SD] age, 37 [12.5] years; 65 women [63.1%]). The most common consent approach was a verbal patient-clinician conversation prior to an individual encounter. Patients and clinicians had a spectrum of comfort with ambient technology; 77 patients (74.8%) reported being comfortable or very comfortable with their physician using ambient documentation. Patient trust, detail in the consent discussion, and intended tool use were associated with patient comfort and intent to consent. Technical understanding was associated with comfort with consent conversations: when provided basic information about the technology, 84 patients (81.6%) consented; this decreased to 57 patients (55.3%) when details about AI features, data storage, and corporate involvement were disclosed. Perceived benefits included reduced documentation burden, improved decision-making, and enhanced communication. Concerns included data security, legal liability, cognitive impacts, and equity. When asked about responsibility for medical errors linked to ambient documentation, 66 patients (64.1%) held physicians accountable; for data security breaches, 79 patients (76.7%) believed vendors should be responsible. Participants suggested a flexible consent model with digital touchpoints, education, nonclinical staff support, and opt-out options.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this quality improvement study of 121 pilot users of AI-assisted ambient documentation technology, informed consent relied primarily on verbal conversations that varied based on time, knowledge, and the patient-clinician relationship. A flexible, multimodal approach-including education, time to discuss risks and benefits, digital resources, nonclinical staff involvement, and clear opt-out options-may improve consent processes and support broader acceptance of ambient documentation tools.',

    title: 'Serum NPTX2 and cognitive impairment in geriatric diabetes: A cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: 'Cognitive impairment is an increasingly common complication of diabetes, yet its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), a recently identified synaptic biomarker linked to cognitive disorders, has not previously been examined in relation to cognitive function in geriatric individuals with diabetes. This cross-sectional study enrolled 90 participants-46 geriatric patients with diabetes and 44 age-matched non-diabetic controls. Demographic and clinical data were collected for all participants. After informed consent, cognitive function was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Serum NPTX2 levels were measured by ELISA. No significant differences were found between the diabetic and control groups in age, sex, education level, marital status, smoking history, comorbid conditions, or polypharmacy. However, the groups differed significantly in MoCA scores (p < 0.001), MMSE scores (p = 0.028), and NPTX2 levels (p = 0.048); the diabetic group showed lower cognitive scores and biomarker levels. NPTX2 levels correlated positively with MoCA and MMSE scores and negatively with diabetes duration, patient age, and the presence of microvascular complications. In conclusion, cognitive function was significantly lower in geriatric patients with diabetes than in controls, and serum NPTX2 levels were significantly associated with cognitive performance. These findings suggest a possible role for NPTX2 in diabetes-related cognitive decline and support further investigation of its utility within a broader biomarker panel.',

    title: 'Challenging Stigma Through Experiential Learning in Clinical and Non-Clinical Mental Health Trainees.',
    abstract: 'Mental health stigma is a pervasive issue which can adversely affect patient care and outcomes. Stigma may manifest through discrimination and negative stereotypes, and can be damaging when inadvertently perpetuated by practitioners and trainees. This study aims explore the effect of experiential learning in decreasing stigma measured by changes in the perceived attitudes and behaviours of trainees at a specialized mental health hospital. Participants (N = 139) are trainees who were scheduled to undergo clinical or non-clinical placement at a mental health hospital. Participants completed a demographic survey prior to placement and a qualitative student evaluation after placement. Validated scales measuring changes in attitude (MICA-4) and behaviour (RIBS), were used as both pre- and post-placement evaluations. Trainee placement variations were accounted for using correlation analysis of the MICA-4 and RIBS data. Most participants identified as females with a college or university education, in their second to fourth years of study. Analysis of both MICA-4 (P = 0.0001) and RIBS (P = 0.009) revealed significant differences between pre-placement and post-placement scores on stigma-related attitudes and behaviours, respectively. These results were supported by qualitative responses which revealed alignment with recovery-oriented philosophy and reflections of stigma. Overall, this study demonstrates possible benefits of experiential learning in mental health care settings to address stigma in clinical and non-clinical trainees.',

    title: 'Development of a nomogram based on METS-IR and SPISE index for predicting mild cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is central to metabolic syndrome and contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Several low-cost surrogate markers have been proposed to assess IR, such as the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, TyG-BMI, TG/HDL-C, metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR), and single-point insulin sensitivity estimator (SPISE). This study aimed to develop nomogram models integrating these indices with clinical data to predict MCI in patients with T2DM.\n' +
      'METHODS: A total of 600 patients diagnosed with T2DM were recruited. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were documented, and cognitive performance was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Logistic regression analyses identified predictors of MCI, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves evaluated their predictive accuracy. Two nomogram models were constructed: Model 1 included METS-IR, age, sex, education level, and hypertension; Model 2 substituted SPISE for METS-IR, retaining other clinical variables.\n' +
      'RESULTS: All IR surrogate indices were significantly associated with MCI and reduced MMSE scores (P < 0.001). METS-IR and SPISE exhibited higher predictive accuracy (AUC: METS-IR = 0.809, SPISE = 0.805) compared to TyG, TyG-BMI, and TG/HDL-C, particularly among female participants. Nomogram models demonstrated robust predictive performance (AUC: Model 1 = 0.846; Model 2 = 0.838).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Nomogram models incorporating METS-IR or SPISE alongside key clinical parameters effectively predicted the risk of MCI among patients with T2DM. These indices notably outperformed other surrogate markers, highlighting their clinical value for early assessment of cognitive risk.',

    title: "Health shocks and households' vulnerability to poverty in Nigeria: a quasi-experimental analysis.",
    abstract: "Health shocks are a critical driver of poverty in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study investigates the impact of health shocks on household poverty risk in Nigeria and evaluates the protective capacity of existing health insurance mechanisms, using data from the 2023/2024 General Household Survey (n = 4,779 households). We first estimated household vulnerability using Chaudhuri's (2003) Vulnerability as Expected Poverty framework, addressing heteroskedasticity in consumption estimation via feasible generalized least squares. We then modeled the probability of household vulnerability following health shocks using probit regression. Finally, we implemented propensity score matching to isolate the effect of health shocks on households' vulnerability. Our results indicate that 56.1% and 59.2% of Nigerian households are vulnerable to poverty, using the international ($2.15/day) and national ($2.48/day) poverty lines, respectively. Vulnerable households are more prevalent in northern regions, rural areas, larger households, and poorer households. We found evidence that, based on the international poverty line, health shocks significantly increased the probability of household vulnerability (ATT = 0.053, SE = 0.023) compared to matched households without health shocks, with a slightly higher impact (ATT = 0.054, SE = 0.023) if using the national poverty line. Household size, dependency ratio, household head's education and employment status, and residence were significant predictors of vulnerability. Despite their potential, health insurance, covering only 2.2% of households, did not offer adequate protection against health shocks. This study provides robust evidence that health shocks increase households' vulnerability to poverty and perpetuate existing poverty. Financial protection measures need to be considered in broader poverty reduction policies.",
