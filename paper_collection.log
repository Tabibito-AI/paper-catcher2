    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'The Role of Remote Activities in Urban Mobility in the Post-COVID-19 Era',
    summary: 'This study examines how remote activities, particularly teleworking and tele-education have been associated with urban mobility patterns in Greece during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing on shifts in travel behavior and attitudes toward future mobility trends, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 1,115 respondents, primarily from Thessaloniki’s academic community. The survey assessed mobility habits across three time periods (pre-, during, and post-pandemic), remote activity practices, future intentions, and socio-demographic factors. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were carried out to identify key determinants shaping future mobility and remote activity preferences. Results show significant behavioral changes, with walking, private vehicle, and bus use declining sharply during the pandemic. Prior to COVID-19, 80% of employees had no teleworking experience, yet 60% transitioned to working remotely five or more days weekly at the pandemic’s peak. Findings highlight strong support for continuing telework and remote learning post-pandemic, indicating lasting shifts in work, education, and urban mobility patterns.',

    title: 'The Effectiveness of 3D Virtual Environments for BPMN Teaching: A Quasi-Experimental Study',
    summary: 'Traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, being static and highly abstract, often hinder comprehension, particularly for novice designers and students. This can lead to misinterpretations and process inefficiencies. In this study, we investigate whether immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments can enhance the understanding of BPMN models. We developed a virtual reality (VR)-based BPMN visualization tool and conducted a quasi -experiment with 48 academic and professional participants, who interacted with a 3D BPMN model using Google Cardboard and a joystick. Participants completed comprehension tasks before and after the VR experience. The results show significant improvements in understanding and engagement, suggesting that immersive virtual reality can be a valuable educational tool for BPMN learning. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the integration of 3D environments in process modeling education, offering benefits for both academic and professional training.',

    title: 'Waste for Knowledge: An IoT-Driven Educational Reward System',
    summary: 'Wastes should not be wasted - it might be opportunities for a brighter future. That is the idea behind Waste4Knowledge, an IoT-driven kiosk that turns discarded items like plastic bottle aluminum cans into opportunities for children to learn and grow. The system incentivizes children to recycle waste materials by rewarding them with items, stationeries, or access to education contents. It uses IoT sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller to check the recyclables and hand out rewards without a hitch. Its modular hardware design, combined with Firebase software, allows real-time data tracking, enabling administrators to analyze recycling trends, adjust reward strategies, and optimize the user experience dynamically. By integrating recycling and education, the W4K system offers opportunities to underprivileged children, fosters environmental responsibility, and inspires positive community behavior. Its adaptable design positions it as a scalable solution for sustainable development initiatives worldwide.',

    title: 'Tech-Enhanced Learning: Evaluating General Education in Vocational Colleges Through Technology Integration',
    summary: 'In vocational education, the role of general education (GE) is pivotal in cultivating a well-rounded skill set among students. As the demands of the job market evolve, it becomes imperative to assess and enhance the efficacy of GE in these specialized settings. Vocational colleges (VC) and higher vocational institutions are essential in getting pupils ready for careers by offering specialized courses. However, the significance of GE cannot be overstated, as it provides a foundation for critical thinking, communication skills, and a broad intellectual perspective. This investigation aims to investigate the evaluation system of GE and related courses within VCs and higher vocational institutions. The study employs a descriptive mixed-methods approach. A purposive sampling technique was utilized to select participants. Using a questionnaire survey and interview method, the data for this paper was gathered from 157 teachers and 208 students. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS for statistical analysis. The findings identified that integrating technology-based evaluation methods enhances the effectiveness of GE programs in VCs. The result clarified that regular feedback and assessment in GE courses in higher VCs lead to better retention and understanding of the course content. The novelty of the study lies in assessing GE and courses in vocational and higher VCs, by exploring unique evaluation systems, it aims to enhance the quality of education, aligning curriculum with industry demands, and promoting well-rounded graduates in vocational settings.',

    title: 'Assessing the role of artificial intelligence in quality of legal education with special reference to sustainable development goal',
    summary: 'The transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly apparent in a variety of fields, including legal education. This study investigates the potential of AI in transforming legal education in order to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), 2030. As nations and cultures global struggle to achieve the SDGs, legal professionals play an important role in establishing legal frameworks that support progress toward these goals. It can improve the delivery of legal curricula by providing customized learning experiences targeted to individuals. AI can also help educators to create current content and enhance the evaluation. Education is now more dynamic, accessible, and affordable, expanding its reach. Quality of legal education is a cornerstone of achieving the SDGs set for 2030. The effective utilization of AI in the field of legal education holds significant promise in not only expanding access but also improving the quality of legal education. AI-powered legal research tools have the potential to revolutionize legal research for law students, researchers, and legal practitioners. They can provide more efficient and comprehensive ways to explore legal precedents, case law, and statutes, thus empowering legal professionals to perform their duties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By improving access to legal information, these tools can play a significant role in the formulation of laws and regulations that align with the SDGs. This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which AI can contribute to advancing legal education and, consequently, supporting the attainment of the SDGs.',

    summary: 'Während sich in den letzten Jahren verschiedene Wissenschaftler:innen mit der Inklusion und dem Bildungserfolg von Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen auseinandergesetzt haben, bleibt die Frage, was diese selbst unter Studienerfolg verstehen, weitgehend außer Acht. Das erste Ziel dieses Artikels ist es, die Konzeptionen von Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Schlüsselfaktoren zu analysieren, die zum Hochschulerfolg von 28 Absolvent:innen mit Beeinträchtigung aus 16 deutschen Hochschulen beigetragen haben. Das zweite Ziel besteht darin, Empfehlungen zu geben, die die Teilnehmenden selbst an andere Studierende mit Beeinträchtigung sowie an die Hochschulen richten, um ihren Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung zu verbessern. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Teilnehmenden unterschiedliche Konzeptionen von Erfolg haben (Erreichen eines Abschlusses, gute Noten, Erlernen und Entwickeln von Fähigkeiten, Sammeln von praktischen Erfahrungen, Überwinden von Herausforderungen und Aufrechterhalten eines Gleichgewichts zwischen Studium und Gesundheit) sowie verschiedene persönliche Faktoren (die Behinderung als treibende Kraft) und kontextuelle Faktoren (soziales und familiäres Umfeld, Auslandsaufenthalte, positives Feedback, Anerkennung von Leistungen und zugängliche Online-Kurse und digitalisierte Materialien) als relevant für ihren Erfolg identifizierten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ferner, dass es für den Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Stärkung von Studierenden mit Beeinträchtigung entscheidend ist, die Stimmen von Absolvent:innen mit Behinderung zu hören. While various researchers have explored inclusion and the educational success of people with impairments in recent years, the question of what the latter mean by academic success remains understudied. The first aim of this article is to analyse the conceptualisations of success in higher education and the key factors that contributed to the academic success of 28 graduates with impairments from 16 German universities. The second aim is to provide recommendations from the participants themselves to other students with impairments and to higher education institutions for improving their success in higher education. The results show that the participants have different conceptualisations of success (achieving a degree, getting good grades, learning and developing skills, gaining practical experience, overcoming challenges and maintaining a balance between studies and health) and identified various personal factors (the disability as a driving force) and contextual factors (social and family environment, time abroad, positive feedback, recognition of achievements and accessible online courses and digitised materials), as relevant to their success. The findings further demonstrate that hearing the voices of graduates with impairments is critical to their success in higher education and the empowerment of students with disabilities.',

    title: 'Supplementation Matters: Academic Impact of an Afterschool Tutoring Program in Timor-Leste',
    summary: 'Students in Timor-Leste face low educational outcomes due to sociopolitical factors rooted in the nation’s colonial history. This study evaluates the academic impact of a low-resource afterschool supplementary tutoring program designed to address learning gaps and improve school outcomes across rural and urban settings. Using instructional design principles, the program employed worksheet-based individualized learning content in a familiar language, supported by personalized feedback. Pre- and post-test scores in mathematics and English were compared over 7 months between an intervention group and a comparison group, with results analyzed using a Welch t test. Findings revealed statistically significant improvements in both subjects, with greater gains in mathematics, suggesting an opportunity to explore alternative methods for English instruction, such as incorporating social interactions to support early learners. The study highlights the importance of community support, tutors’ capabilities, and their residence within local neighborhoods in sustaining the program. These results demonstrate the potential of well-structured afterschool programs to enhance educational outcomes in low-resource contexts, offering a scalable model for similar initiatives in emerging nations.',

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. These instructional strategies aim to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a tool that can promote substantive student involvement and meaningful learning. (An initial draft of this abstract was produced by ChatGPT 4.0, but GenAI was not used in any other way for this article, other than as an interactive partner within the excerpts as clearly marked.)',

Material und Methoden Die Online-Befragung wurde während des dritten Lockdowns, von März bis Juli 2021, in Hessen und anderen Bundesländern durchgeführt. Der Feldzugang erfolgte in weiterführenden Schulen, Verbänden und Sportvereinen. Der Online-Fragebogen wurde von N  = 1096 Schüler*innen der Klassenstufe 6 bis 13 aufgerufen und n  = 361 Schüler*innen vollständig ausgefüllt. Es wurden das gesundheitsbezogene Informationssuchverhalten (internetbasierte Quellen für Gesundheitsinformationen, [digitale] Quellen für Informationen zur Coronapandemie), die dGK (Digital Health Literacy Instrument [DHLI]) sowie soziodemografische und -ökonomische Hintergrundmerkmale (Geschlecht, Alter, zuhause gesprochene Sprache, Schulform, subjektiver Sozialstatus) erfasst und mittels uni-, bi- und multivariater Analysen mit SPSS ausgewertet. Ergebnisse Nach Gesundheitsinformationen zum Coronavirus im Internet suchten regelmäßig 75,6 % der Schüler*innen. Schwierigkeiten beim Umgang mit digitalen Gesundheitsinformationen gaben 52,6 % der Schüler*innen an. 49,8 % der Schüler*innen berichteten von Schwierigkeiten beim Bewerten der Zuverlässigkeit von digitalen Informationen zum Coronavirus. Die bi- und multivariaten Analysen weisen darauf hin, dass sich die dGK nach dem subjektiven Sozialstatus (SSS) dahingehend unterscheidet, dass Schüler*innen mit niedrigem bzw. mittlerem SSS (OR = 2,57, 95 %-KI: 1,30–5,06, p  = 0,006) häufiger Schwierigkeiten im Umgang mit digitalen Gesundheitsinformationen zur Coronapandemie aufweisen als Gleichaltrige der Vergleichsgruppen. Die dGK unterscheidet sich nicht signifikant nach soziodemografischen (Geschlecht, Migrationshintergrund) und weiteren sozialen Merkmalen (besuchte Schulform, familiärer Wohlstand). Schlussfolgerung Die Förderung der dGK von Schüler*innen auf Schul- und Individualebene stellt ein wichtiges Anliegen der Prävention und Gesundheitsförderung dar. Durch bildungspolitische Maßnahmen (z. B. durch den „Medienkompetenzrahmen“ für die schulischen Medienbildung in den Bundesländern) sollte es den Schulen ermöglicht werden, die (d)GK im Rahmen der Medien- und Gesundheitsbildung in den Unterricht, Curricula und auf allen Ebenen von und bei allen Akteuren in Schulen (bspw. durch die organisationale Gesundheitskompetenz) zu berücksichtigen. Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, schoolchildren were confronted with a flood of information on health and the coronavirus. Adequate handling of health information requires (digital) health literacy (dHL). The aim of this article is therefore to analyse the information-seeking behaviour and the extent of dHL of schoolchildren in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic according to their social background. Materials and methods The online survey was conducted during the third lockdown, from March–July 2021, in Hesse and other German federal states. Students in secondary schools, associations and sports clubs were contacted. The online questionnaire was accessed by N  = 1096 schoolchildren in grades 6–13 and n  = 361 schoolchildren completed it in full. Health-related information-seeking behaviour (internet-based sources for health information, [digital] sources for information on the COVID-19 pandemic), dHL (Digital Health Literacy Instrument [DHLI]) as well as sociodemographic and socioeconomic background characteristics (gender, age, language spoken at home, type of school, subjective social status) were recorded and evaluated using uni-, bi- and multivariate analyses with SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Results In all, 75.6% of schoolchildren regularly searched for digital health information about the coronavirus. 52.6% of the schoolchildren reported difficulties in dealing with digital health information. 49.8% of the schoolchildren reported difficulties in assessing the reliability of digital information on the coronavirus. The bi- and multivariate analyses indicated that the dHL differs according to subjective social status (SSS) in that those students with low or medium SSS (odds ratio = 2.57, 95% confidence interval 1.30–5.06, p  = 0.006) more frequently have difficulties in dealing with digital health information on the COVID-19 pandemic than their peers in the comparison groups. The dHL did not differ significantly according to sociodemographic (gender, migration background) and other social characteristics (type of school attended, family wealth). Conclusion Promotion of (d)HL among schoolchildren at school and individual level is an important issue for prevention and health promotion. Educational policy measures (e.g. in the form of “media literacy frameworks” for school media education in the federal states) should enable schools to take (d)HL into account in the context of media and health education in lessons, curricula and at all levels of and among all actors in schools (e.g. through organisational health literacy).',

    title: 'Context Matters: Exploring the Structural Relationships Between ICT Usage, Support, Perceived Usefulness, Intention to Use, and Learning Motivation',
    summary: 'Previous research has extensively explored the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education. However, much of previous research has not differentiated between the environments where ICT is used, particularly in terms of its perceived usefulness in school versus at home. This gap in understanding the contextual influence of ICT on students’ learning motivation forms the basis for this study. In particular, this research aims to clarify how different environments influence the effectiveness of ICT in motivating students. Using data from 737 high school students, collected through two surveys, and employing Structural Equation Modeling, the study found that ICT usage in schools is positively linked to its perceived usefulness in both school and home environments. Additionally, ICT support from teachers enhances the perceived usefulness of ICT in both contexts. Furthermore, the perceived usefulness of ICT in both school and home environments significantly predicts students’ intentions to use ICT. However, only the perceived usefulness of ICT at home significantly predicts learning motivation, contrary to initial expectations that school-related ICT would also be a significant predictor. These findings suggest that enhancing students’ learning motivation through ICT integration may require more emphasis on the home environment. The implications for educational policy and practice are discussed, emphasizing a more efficient strategy in incorporating ICT into education.',

    title: "Facilitators and barriers in Academic-Practice Partnerships (APPs) between Approved Educational Institutions (AEIs) and Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) during pre-registration nursing students' placements: a systematic review protocol.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Effective Academic-Practice Partnerships (APPs) between Approved Educational Institutions (AEIs) and practice learning partners are essential for enhancing the integration of the theoretical and practical aspects of nursing education. Recent literature regarding nursing student placements in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) highlights the significance of these partnerships and a need to explore the dynamic partnerships between AEIs and RACFs to better understand their role in improving student experiences and learning outcomes. Despite the recognition of the significance of understanding these APPs, this remains a significant gap in the existing literature.\n' +
      "METHODS: We will conduct a systematic review to identify facilitators and barriers to maintaining productive APPs between AEI and RACFs during pre-registration nursing student placements. Our research will involve an electronic literature search within MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and ERIC. Two independent reviewers will screen eligible papers, and a third reviewer will resolve any conflicts based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible studies must have been published in English after 1990, and they should specifically address collaborative efforts between AEIs and RACFs in the context of pre-registration nursing student placements. All studies will be appraised using Caldwell's Framework. Findings will be extracted using a standardised extraction table, and an in-depth synthesis will be conducted using thematic analysis.\n" +
      'DISCUSSION: This systematic review addresses a gap in the literature by identifying key factors that influence APPs in the context of RACF placements. The findings from this review have the potential to guide improvements in pre-registration nursing education by informing, nurturing, and supporting collaborative relationships between AEIs and RACFs, which promote enriched experiences for nursing students during their RACF placements. The review will also provide both clinical and academic educators with a deeper understanding of what facilitates and hinders collaboration, which will empower them to facilitate effective collaboration and develop their shared capacity in supporting students. Strengthening the partnerships between AEIs and RACFs fosters a shared vision and enhances the quality of pre-registration nursing education, which improves the standard of care for RACF residents.',

    title: 'Factors associated with the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in adults.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Hypovitaminosis D has a significant negative impact on general health. Although some factors associated with hypovitaminosis D have been previously reported, they have seldom been analyzed simultaneously in community-based research. This study aims to investigate some potential factors associated with serum 25 (OH)D level, representing a vitamin concentration.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional study recruiting 4,457 adults, aged over 18 years, was conducted between August 2019 and December 2023. Sociodemographic data were obtained through structured questionnaires, while anthropometric measurements, hemogram results, and biochemical markers were collected from medical records and physical examination findings. A self-reported depression rating score; health beliefs; and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) factors were assessed with questionnaires. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The mean serum 25(OH)D level was 29.22 ± 10.45 ng/mL. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that serum 25(OH)D levels were positively associated with age (β = 0.258, p < 0.001), male sex (β = 0.164, p < 0.001), high school education level (β = 0.118, p < 0.001), smoking exposure (β = 0.044, p = 0.011), alcohol consumption (β = 0.150, p < 0.001), hemoglobin concentration (β = 0.062, p = 0.001), calcium level (β = 0.047, p = 0.005), and the mental component score of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (β = 0.086, p < 0.001). Conversely, serum 25(OH)D levels were negatively associated with coffee consumption (β = - 0.045, p = 0.002), estimated glomerular filtration rate (β = - 0.105, p < 0.001), blood levels of intact parathyroid hormone (β = - 0.184, p < 0.001), phosphorus (β = - 0.033, p = 0.040), and triglycerides (β = - 0.060, p < 0.001). The overall model explained 29.6% of the variance in serum 25(OH)D levels (R² = 0.296). There were close correlations between sociodemographic factors, anthropometric variables, hemograms, biochemical data, self-reported depression rating scores, health beliefs, and HRQoL factors.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several key variables associated with serum 25(OH)D levels in adults. These findings provide important targets for designing health education programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency. Future community-based research should consider incorporating additional determinants of vitamin D status, including quantified sunlight exposure, dietary intake of vitamin D-rich foods, and supplementation patterns. Accounting for these broader lifestyle and environmental factors may enable subsequent studies to generate more robust insights into the multifactorial nature of vitamin D regulation and inform more effective public health strategies.',

    title: 'Enablers and barriers in the professional development of nurses employed full-time at university nursing studies in Croatia: a qualitative study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have highlighted the challenges faced by nurse educators working in an academic setting. However, to date, no published research has explored this issue in the Croatian context. This study explored and described the enablers and barriers to the professional development of full-time nurses employed in university-level nursing education programs in Croatia.\n' +
      'METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted from February to March 2024. Participants were full-time nurse educators holding teaching positions at 12 university-level nursing programs across Croatia. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview guide and analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of the 58 individuals who met the inclusion criteria, 52 (90%) nurse educators participated in the study. The sample comprised 10 men and 42 women, ranging in age from 28 to 64 years. Participants identified work overload, particularly the burden of administrative tasks and competing responsibilities, as the primary barrier to their professional development. Additional challenges included limited time and resources, difficulties in organising clinical practice and mentoring, and a perceived disconnect between academic and clinical settings. Despite these challenges, the majority of participants reported overall satisfaction with their academic careers, highlighting the intrinsic value of knowledge dissemination, student engagement, and professional growth. Institutional support was noted in the form of co-financed educational opportunities, mentorship, and involvement in decision-making processes.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that improvements in working conditions and employment policies are needed to enhance job satisfaction among nurses employed in university nursing programs in Croatia. Key areas for intervention include reducing administrative burdens, strengthening management and organizational structures, increasing institutional support, and promoting access to continuous professional education. These factors are essential to fostering the professional development of nurses within an academic setting.\n' +

    title: 'Prevalence and patterns of multiple long-term conditions among lymphatic filariasis patients in Odisha, India: a community-based cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), such as lymphatic filariasis, mimic other chronic conditions and share common risk behaviors with parallel health system issues that require unique interventions. Multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs or multimorbidity), defined as two or more chronic conditions has become increasingly common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India. However, data on the prevalence of the interface between NTDs and other chronic conditions are lacking. We estimated the prevalence and correlates of MLTC, assessed the commonly occurring patterns, and investigated the association between self-rated health (SRH) and the number of chronic conditions among patients with lymphatic filariasis.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Odisha, India, using a prevalidated MLTC assessment tool. We employed systematic random sampling to recruit 584 participants aged ≥ 18 years having lymphatic filariasis. MLTC was defined as the coexistence of one or more chronic conditions along with lymphatic filariasis. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the correlates presented as adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to identify the major clusters of chronic conditions. An ordinal regression model was used to assess the association between SRH and the number of chronic conditions.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The overall prevalence of MLTC was 68.8% (95% CI: 64.9-72.6), while the mean number of chronic conditions was 2 ± 2.3. The chance of having MLTCs was greater among males [AOR: 3.9 (95% CI: 2.1-7.3)] than females. Participants with education at the primary and secondary school levels had greater odds of having MLTC [AOR: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.3-3.7)] and [AOR: 2.3 (95% CI: 1.3-3.8)], respectively. The commonly observed triad was lymphatic filariasis with arthritis and peptic ulcer disease (1.5%), while the most common tetrad was lymphatic filariasis, hypertension, diabetes and peptic ulcer disease (0.7%). There was a per unit decrease in SRH with each additional chronic condition.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: We observed a high prevalence of MLTC among people with lymphatic filariasis. The findings of this study will not only be useful for both resource and planning in India but also in similar LMICs with a high burden of lymphatic filariasis.',

    title: 'Examining the relationship between perceived fear of pain and empathic tendencies of nursing students and the affecting factors: a cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: The relationship between fear of pain and empathic tendency is important because empathy plays a critical role in recognizing and managing patient pain, while fear of pain can affect the nurse's reactions and emotional resilience. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between perceived fear of pain and empathic tendencies of nursing students and the affecting factors.\n" +
      'METHODS: The data of this descriptive, cross-sectional and relational study were collected digitally from a total of 396 nursing students studying at a state university between May 1 and September 30, 2023. A census sampling approach was used, as the entire target population (N = 448) was known in advance, and 81.06% os it was successfully reached. The data were obtained using the Introductory Information Form, Fear of Pain Scale-III and Empathic Tendency Scale.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A weak, positive but statistically non-significant correlation was found between emphatic tendency and fear of pain (r = 0.056, p = 0.267). Statistically significant differences in fear of pain scores were found in relation to gender (p = 0.002), age group (p = 0.001), grade level (p = 0.001), and willingness to choose the department (p = 0.038). Similarly, empathic tendency scores differed significantly according to gender (p = 0.014), family type (p = 0.001), grade level (p = 0.010), and willingness to choose the department (p = 0.016).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Among all significant variables, students who did not choose the department willingly presented both higher fear of pain scores and lower empathic tendency scores. Therefore, they represent a high-risk group that may particularly benefit from targeted interventions, such as simulation-based empathy and coping workshops.\n' +

    title: 'Integrating web-based and objective structured clinical examination training programs for nurses on ultrasound hip screening during neonatal and infant home visits: a case study.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Ultrasound hip screening is crucial for the early detection of developmental dysplasia (DDH), but little is known about standardized training approaches for nurses. This study aimed to evaluate an educational program combining web-based learning and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) training to improve nurses' knowledge and skills in ultrasound hip screening and DDH prevention during universal neonatal and infant home visits.\n" +
      'METHODS: The program targeted two objectives: (1) to enable nurses to understand the Graf method and acquire standard plane ultrasound images, and (2) to equip them to provide preventive health education on DDH. The intervention included five web-based modules and a two-day OSCE-based hands-on program, supervised by orthopedic pediatric surgeons. Outcomes included (1) knowledge test scores obtained from the web-based modules (range: 0-50 points), (2) OSCE scores (36 items, range: 0-360; global rating ≧3 on a 1-6), including delivery of preventive health education, (3) ability to capture a standard plane image using a phantom within three minutes, and (4) ability to capture a standard plane image with infant volunteers, assessed by medical supervisors.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Nineteen participants (18 public health nurses and one midwife) from three municipalities completed the program. The mean knowledge test score was 47.2 (SD: 2.2), and the mean OSCE score was 329.3 (SD: 21.7), with a global rating of 4.4 (SD: 0.7). All participants conducted the preventive health education component. Eighteen participants (right hip) and 17 (left hip) successfully captured standard plane images using a phantom within three minutes. In scans of 39 infant volunteers, 34 scans (87.2%) successfully captured the standard plane; participants self-reported 31 as successful, though two were objectively classified as failures.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The educational program improved nurses' ultrasound hip-screening skills and their capacity to deliver preventive health education during universal home visits. These findings support the potential feasibility of expanding nurse-led ultrasound screening and DDH prevention efforts in community settings.\n" +

    title: 'Nutrition literacy across adolescence stages in Egypt: a quartile-based analysis for tailored educational strategies.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Low nutrition literacy (NL) among adolescents can worsen health and economic inequalities, potentially leading to a higher burden of non-communicable diseases.\n' +
      'AIM: This study aimed to assess Total Nutrition Literacy (TNL) and its domains across different adolescent stages with an in-depth look at NL among Egyptian adolescents, through a quartile-based approach. It analysed the relation between adequate NL influences and vitamin, mineral intakes and body mass index (BMI) categories (underweight, normal, overweight/obese). It explored the effects of adolescent characteristics (gender, BMI) and family environment (parental education, food literacy, health status) on achieving adequate TNL levels.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,050 Egyptian adolescents aged 10-19 from various geographical and socioeconomic backgrounds. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire measuring demographic information, TNL and its domains (categories) (Functional (FNL), Interactive (INL), and Critical (CNL)), and parental food literacy (PFL). Anthropometric measurements assessed nutritional status via BMI. Statistical analyses using SPSS identified associations and predictors of adequate TNL.\n' +
      'RESULTS: TNL scores rose significantly from 68.8 in early adolescence (10-13 years) to 77.4 in late adolescence (17-19 years) (p < 0.001). All domains improved with age (p < 0.001), with females outperforming males in INL and CNL (p < 0.001). FNL level was notably low at 56.6%, compared to higher rates in INL (84.1%) and CNL (91.0%). Meanwhile, the median scores for NL remain relatively close to the lower levels of adequacy across all stages. Parental employment, PFL, health status, and family dynamics were significant predictors of adequate TNL. Maternal education became particularly crucial in late adolescence, while PFL had the greatest influence in early and middle adolescence. Adequate TNL increased the likelihood of reporting vitamin intake by nearly five times (COR = 4.9, p < 0.01). The relation between TNL and its domains with BMI vary across adolescence.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: Using quartile distribution to assess literacy adequacy provided a detailed view of literacy gaps, allowing identification of adolescents most in need of intervention. NL programs have to be tailored to meet adolescents' evolving needs, emphasizing foundational literacy in early adolescence, interactive skills in middle adolescence, and critical literacy in late adolescence.",

    title: 'Wristful thinking: exploring the effects of robotic rehabilitation and cross-education for persons with multiple sclerosis.',
    abstract: 'The goal of this work was to develop an adaptive rehabilitation technique using a haptic wrist robot that would induce cross-education to an untrained limb. Fourteen individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and eight non-affected adults completed an eight-week intervention. MS participants were placed into two groups, training their more affected limb (direct training), and training their less affected limb (indirect training). The purpose of the intervention was to improve wrist and grip strength (measured via maximal grip and isometric wrist strength) and motor control (measured via robotic assessments). Participants trained with the robotic device three times per week for eight consecutive weeks. Training consisted of eccentric contractions as the participant resisted a force elicited from the robotic device as it moved in flexion, extension, and radial-ulnar deviation. The MS group reported significant increases in wrist strength. The indirect training group significantly improved in flexion, extension, radial and ulnar deviation in the trained limb, and flexion and radial deviation in the untrained limb. The direct training group showed improvements in extension and ulnar deviation in both limbs. The control group improved in radial and ulnar deviation, with radial deviation improving in the untrained limb. Grip force remained unchanged for all groups. MS participants significantly decreased tracking and figural error post-intervention suggesting evidence that motor control adaptations occurred following an adaptive and resistive robotic intervention of the upper limb. Results of this work provide evidence that eight-week robotic rehabilitation can elicit cross-education effects to the untrained limb.',
