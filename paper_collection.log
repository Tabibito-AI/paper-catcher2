    title: 'Current and Emergent Economic Impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK Fresh\n' +
      '  Produce and Horticultural Businesses',
    summary: 'This paper describes a study designed to investigate the current and emergent\n' +
      'impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK horticultural businesses. Various\n' +
      'characteristics of UK horticultural production, notably labour reliance and\n' +
      'import dependence, make it an important sector for policymakers concerned to\n' +
      'understand the effects of these disruptive events as we move from 2020 into\n' +
      '2021. The study design prioritised timeliness, using a rapid survey to gather\n' +
      'information from a relatively small (n = 19) but indicative group of producers.\n' +
      'The main novelty of the results is to suggest that a very substantial majority\n' +
      'of producers either plan to scale back production in 2021 (47%) or have been\n' +
      'unable to make plans for 2021 because of uncertainty (37%). The results also\n' +
      'add to broader evidence that the sector has experienced profound labour supply\n' +
      'challenges, with implications for labour cost and quality. The study discusses\n' +
      'the implications of these insights from producers in terms of productivity and\n' +
      'automation, as well as in terms of broader economic implications. Although\n' +
      'automation is generally recognised as the long-term future for the industry\n' +
      '(89%), it appeared in the study as the second most referred short-term option\n' +
      '(32%) only after changes to labour schemes and policies (58%). Currently,\n' +
      "automation plays a limited role in contributing to the UK's horticultural\n" +
      'workforce shortage due to economic and socio-political uncertainties. The\n' +
      'conclusion highlights policy recommendations and future investigative\n' +
      'intentions, as well as suggesting methodological and other discussion points\n' +
      'for the research community.',

    title: 'Modelling the emergence of spatial patterns of economic activity',
    summary: 'Understanding how spatial configurations of economic activity emerge is\n' +
      'important when formulating spatial planning and economic policy. A simple model\n' +
      'was proposed by Simon, who assumed that firms grow at a rate proportional to\n' +
      'their size, and that new divisions of firms with certain probabilities relocate\n' +
      "to other firms or to new centres of economic activity. Simon's model produces\n" +
      'realistic results in the sense that the sizes of economic centres follow a Zipf\n' +
      'distribution, which is also observed in reality. It lacks realism in the sense\n' +
      'that mechanisms such as cluster formation, congestion (defined as an overly\n' +
      'high density of the same activities) and dependence on the spatial distribution\n' +
      'of external parties (clients, labour markets) are ignored.\n' +
      '  The present paper proposed an extension of the Simon model that includes both\n' +
      'centripetal and centrifugal forces. Centripetal forces are included in the\n' +
      'sense that firm divisions are more likely to settle in locations that offer a\n' +
      'higher accessibility to other firms. Centrifugal forces are represented by an\n' +
      'aversion of a too high density of activities in the potential location. The\n' +
      'model is implemented as an agent-based simulation model in a simplified spatial\n' +
      'setting. By running both the Simon model and the extended model, comparisons\n' +
      'are made with respect to their effects on spatial configurations. To this end a\n' +
      'series of metrics are used, including the rank-size distribution and indices of\n' +
      'the degree of clustering and concentration.',

    title: 'Evolution of family systems and resultant socio-economic structures',
    summary: 'Families form the basis of society, and anthropologists have characterised\n' +
      'various family systems. This study developed a multi-level evolutionary model\n' +
      'of pre-industrial agricultural societies to simulate the evolution of family\n' +
      'systems and determine how each of them adapts to environmental conditions and\n' +
      'forms a characteristic socio-economic structure. In the model, competing\n' +
      'societies evolve, which themselves comprise multiple evolving families that\n' +
      'grow through family labour. Each family has two strategy parameters: the time\n' +
      'children leave the parental home and the distribution of inheritance among\n' +
      'siblings. The evolution of these parameters demonstrates that four basic family\n' +
      'systems emerge; families can become either nuclear or extended, and have either\n' +
      'an equal or unequal inheritance distribution. Nuclear families emerge where\n' +
      'land resources are sufficient, whereas extended families emerge where land\n' +
      'resources are limited. Equal inheritance emerges where the amount of wealth\n' +
      'required for a family to survive is large, whereas unequal inheritance emerges\n' +
      'where the required wealth is small. Analyses on the wealth distribution of\n' +
      'families demonstrate a higher level of poverty in extended families, and that\n' +
      'the accumulation of wealth is accelerated for unequal inheritance. By comparing\n' +
      'wealth distributions in the model with historical data, family systems are\n' +
      'associated with characteristic economic structures and modern social\n' +
      'ideologies. Empirical data analyses using the cross-cultural ethnographic\n' +
      'database verify the theoretical relationship between the environmental\n' +
      'conditions, family systems, and socio-economic structures. Theoretical studies\n' +
      'by this simple constructive model, as presented here, will integrate the\n' +
      'understandings of family systems in evolutionary anthropology, demography, and\n' +
      'socioeconomic histories.',

    title: 'In the Shadow of Smith`s Invisible Hand: Risks to Economic Stability and\n' +
      '  Social Wellbeing in the Age of Intelligence',
    summary: 'Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing\n' +
      'financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of\n' +
      'generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job\n' +
      'displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to\n' +
      'offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of\n' +
      'economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented\n' +
      'scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and\n' +
      'examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures\n' +
      'that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job\n' +
      'security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to\n' +
      'undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour\n' +
      'underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a\n' +
      'moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour\n' +
      'underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable\n' +
      'income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index\n' +
      'by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per\n' +
      'capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at\n' +
      'least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary.\n' +
      'Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold\n' +
      'beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in\n' +
      'consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the\n' +
      'urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study\n' +
      'underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work\n' +
      'together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard\n' +
      'the Mental Wealth of nations.',

      '  computational economic analysis',
    summary: 'Our computational economic analysis investigates the relationship between\n' +

    summary: 'We propose a high level network architecture for an economic system that\n' +

      'and redeeming a digital coin using a mechanism to create a sustainable global\n' +

      'therefore be money proper, we claim it must be issued by the buyer and backed\n' +

    title: 'Structural Change, Employment, and Inequality in Europe: an Economic\n' +
      '  Complexity Approach',
    summary: 'Structural change consists of industrial diversification towards more\n' +
      'productive, knowledge intensive activities. However, changes in the productive\n' +
      'structure bear inherent links with job creation and income distribution. In\n' +
      'this paper, we investigate the consequences of structural change, defined in\n' +
      'terms of labour shifts towards more complex industries, on employment growth,\n' +
      'wage inequality, and functional distribution of income. The analysis is\n' +
      'conducted for European countries using data on disaggregated industrial\n' +
      'employment shares over the period 2010-2018. First, we identify patterns of\n' +
      'industrial specialisation by validating a country-industry industrial\n' +
      'employment matrix using a bipartite weighted configuration model (BiWCM).\n' +
      'Secondly, we introduce a country-level measure of labour-weighted Fitness,\n' +
      'which can be decomposed in such a way as to isolate a component that identifies\n' +
      'the movement of labour towards more complex industries, which we define as\n' +
      'structural change. Thirdly, we link structural change to i) employment growth,\n' +
      'ii) wage inequality, and iii) labour share of the economy. The results indicate\n' +
      'that our structural change measure is associated negatively with employment\n' +
      'growth. However, it is also associated with lower income inequality. As\n' +
      'countries move to more complex industries, they drop the least complex ones, so\n' +
      'the (low-paid) jobs in the least complex sectors disappear. Finally, structural\n' +
      'change predicts a higher labour ratio of the economy; however, this is likely\n' +
      'to be due to the increase in salaries rather than by job creation.',

    title: 'Workforce migration and its economic implications: A perspective from\n' +
      '  social media in China',
    summary: 'The workforce remains the most basic element of social production, even in\n' +
      'modern societies. Its migration, especially for developing economies such as\n' +
      'China, plays a strong role in the reallocation of productive resources and\n' +
      'offers a promising proxy for understanding socio-economic issues. Nevertheless,\n' +
      'due to long cycle, expensive cost and coarse granularity, conventional surveys\n' +
      'face challenges in comprehensively profiling it. With the permeation of smart\n' +
      'and mobile devices in recent decades, booming social media has essentially\n' +
      'broken spatio-temporal constraints and enabled the continuous sensing of the\n' +
      'real-time mobility of massive numbers of individuals. In this study, we\n' +
      'demonstrate that similar to a natural shock, the Spring Festival culturally\n' +
      'drives workforce travel between workplaces and hometowns, and the trajectory\n' +
      'footprints from social media therefore open a window with unparalleled richness\n' +
      'and fine granularity to explore laws in national-level workforce migration. To\n' +
      'understand the core driving forces of workforce migration flux between cities\n' +

      'introduced into our prediction model. We find that urban GDP (gross domestic\n' +
      'product) and travel time are two excellent indicators to help make predictions.\n' +
      'Diverse migration patterns are then revealed by clustering the trajectories,\n' +
      'which give important clues to help understand the different roles of Chinese\n' +
      'cities in their own development and in regional economic development. These\n' +
      'patterns are further explained as a joint effect of the subjective will to seek\n' +
      'personal benefits and the capacity requirements of local labour markets. Our\n' +

    title: 'The economics of diversity: Innovation, productivity and the labour market',
    abstract: 'The empirical evidence on the economic impacts of diversity is mixed. Many studies in the literature present context dependent and data driven results which are challenging to reconcile with each other. This paper offers a systematic synthesis of the empirical findings on the economic impacts of diversity on innovation, productivity, and the labour market. It presents a structured framework which takes the spatial scale of the analysis in the papers as a reference to understand the inconsistency of some previous predictions and the varying magnitudes of the diversity impact. The empirical findings reconcile more meaningfully when diversity effects are documented discretely at the regional, firm and individual levels. The paper further sets out an agenda for future research and links the findings for policy relevance.',

    title: 'The future of the standard employment relationship: Labour law, new institutional economics and old power resource theory',
    abstract: 'This article addresses two questions about the standard employment relationship that have become prominent in labour law literature: Does it exacerbate inequality? Is its decline inevitable? The focus is on the second question and emphasizes the extent to which the standard employment relationship was both embedded in, and the outcome of, an institutional ensemble that was fashioned out of the post-war capital–labour compromise in industrialized democracies. The analysis proceeds in three steps. The first is conceptual and stresses the distinctive nature of labour as a fictive commodity, and the recurring regulatory dilemmas that arise in any attempt to institutionalize a labour market. The second step historicizes and contextualizes the employment relationship, emphasizing politics and conflict (power resource theory) over rational choice and coordination (new institutional economics) as the basis for its institutionalization. The emphasis on politics, power and labour leads to the third step, which focuses on how the broad process of financialization influences three key institutions – the large manufacturing firm, the democratic welfare state and autonomous trade unions – that have been crucial for the development of the standard employment relationship.',

    abstract: 'The implications of the capability approach for the positive and normative analysis of labour law are considered in this chapter. It is argued that the capability approach does not offer a complete theory of labour law and does not, in itself, provide substantive guidance for labour law reform, but that it offers a distinct ontological and methodological perspective which can help to reframe the debate over the economic effects of labour law. In its emphasis on the importance of institutions for creating the conditions for human freedom, and in its advocacy of a range of indicators of human well-being beyond those based on economic growth alone, the capability approach underpins the idea that labour law can play a role in creating the conditions for sustainable development.',

    title: 'The new economics of labour migration and the role of remittances in the migration process.',
    abstract: '\n' +
      " This analysis considers international migration remittances and their impact on development in migrant-sending areas. The new economics of labor migration (NELM) posit that remittances lessen production and market constraints faced by households in poor developing countries. The article states that remittances may be a positive factor in economic development, which should be nurtured by economic policies. The impact of remittances and migration on development varies across locales and is influenced by migrants' remittance behavior and by economic contexts. Criteria for measuring development gains may include assessments of income growth, inequity, and poverty alleviation. It is hard to gauge the level of remittances, especially when remittances may not flow through formal banking systems. The International Monetary Fund distinguishes between worker remittances sent home for over 1 year; employee compensation including the value of in-kind benefits for under 1 year; and the net worth of migrants who move between countries. This sum amounted to under $2 billion in 1970 and $70 billion in 1995. The cumulative sum of remittances, employee compensation, and transfers was almost $1 trillion, of which almost 66% was worker remittances, 25% was employee compensation, and almost 10% was transfers during 1980-95. Total world remittances surpass overseas development assistance. Remittances are unequally distributed across and between countries. Migration research does not adequately reveal the range and complexity of impacts. Push factors can limit options for use of remittances to stimulate development.\n",

    title: 'The New Economics of Labour Migration (NELM): Econometric Analysis of Remittances from Italy to Rural Bangladesh Based on Kinship Relation',
    abstract: 'This paper analysed the household head relation to the migrant and remittances determinants among ten villages on the remittances receiving households in rural Bangladesh. The household survey data from Bangladesh for the period of July to December, 2013, to analyse determinants of remittances at the left behind household members. Rather than multilevel models, use a three stages backward regressions elimination estimation process and build up econometric best fit model of remittances, which helps us the focus the analysis on the explanation of remittances determinants heterogeneity in micro-economic level of studies. The empirical findings suggest that the household head relation to the migrant is one of the strong determinants of remittances as well as other variables. In addition, the household head relation to migrant such a father, mother, brother and wife also have different influential factors while the most common variable as number of visit by the migrant at the origin is strongly associates with all the relationship to the migrant although level of significance has slightly discrimination. Overall, the findings suggests that the age of migrant are strongly associates with father, wife and brother relation of the household head while the age of household head as father and wife. The investment in housing development strongly associates wife, brother and mother household head whereas household living expenses with father and wife. Individual determinants such as household income, land and marital status of the migrant are strongly associates with father, wife and mother household head respectively.',

Written by 2015 Nobel Laureate Angus Deaton and John Muellbauer, the book begins with a self-contained presentation of the basic theory and its use in applied econometrics. These early chapters also include elementary extensions of the theory to labour supply, durable goods, the consumption function, and rationing. The rest of the book is divided into three parts. In the first of these the authors discuss restrictions on choice and aggregation problems. The next part consists of chapters on consumer index numbers; household characteristics, demand, and household welfare comparisons; and social welfare and inequality. The last part extends the coverage of consumer behaviour to include the quality of goods and household production theory, labour supply and human capital theory, the consumption function and intertemporal choice, the demand for durable goods, and choice under uncertainty.',

    title: "The Economics of Long‐Term Contracts in the Footballers' Labour Market",
    abstract: `type="main" xml:id="sjpe12064-abs-0001"> Peter Sloane's seminal article in this journal on the objectives of football clubs argued that utility maximising clubs would seek out player talent more aggressively than profit maximising clubs and that this accumulation of player talent by larger teams might need to be checked by redistribution of revenues. We suggest in this article that, in a context of rising revenues and high rewards, the pressures to acquire more and better talent so as to out-perform other teams on the football pitch leads to a requirement for teams to practise effective contract management. Using a large dataset from the German Bundesliga, we find that players with longer term contracts perform better, ceteris paribus. Hence, selection effects in the award of long-term contracts dominate moral hazard (shirking) effects in the Bundesliga.`,

The article distinguishes between ‘economic analysis of law’ and ‘law and economics’, with the former applying economic models to generally simple legal rules while the latter blends messier institutional detail with legal and economic thought. The article describes three eras of law-and-economics scholarship, recognizing that economics teaches that markets work and markets fail. Era One emphasizes that labour laws and mandatory employment rules might reduce overall social welfare by preventing a benefit or term from going to the party that values it most highly. Era Two emphasizes that labour and employment laws might enhance overall social welfare by correcting market failures arising from monopsony power, externalities, public goods, asymmetric information, information-processing heuristics, and internal labour markets. Era Three uses empirical methods to referee between markets-work and markets-fail approaches. The article argues that unequal bargaining power is not a standard market failure, because even powerful employers have a profit-maximizing motive to provide benefits, such as vacation or safety, that workers are willing to pay for.',

    title: 'Cellular dynamics of cervical remodelling: insights from preterm and term labour',
    summary: 'Introduction Preterm birth remains a global health challenge with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Despite extensive research, the underlying mechanisms triggering preterm birth remain elusive, needing a deeper understanding of cervical cellular remodelling processes. Purpose This study aims to elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying cervical remodelling in spontaneous preterm labour (PTL) compared to term labour (TL), focusing on the roles of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study from October 2018 to March 2021, at two hospitals. Participants were categorized into two groups: PTL ( n  = 14), TL ( n  = 14). A small set ( n  = 6) of preterm not in labour (PTnotL) was also included. Cervical biopsies were obtained and analysed for the density of fibroblasts and inflammatory cells (neutrophils and mononuclear cells) using digital image analysis. Statistical analysis was performed employing Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Results There was no significant overall difference in global inflammatory cell density between PTL and TL ( p  = 0.154). However, a detailed analysis revealed significantly higher inflammation in the exocervix of PTL compared to TL, particularly involving neutrophils ( p  = 0.021) and mononuclear cells ( p  = 0.028). Neutrophils ( p  = 0.035), but not mononuclear cells ( p  = 0.111), were significantly decreased in PTnotL exocervix compared to PTL. No differences were found in inflammatory cell density in the endocervix. Fibroblast densities were similar across groups. Conclusions This study highlights the distinct cellular profiles in the cervix during preterm and term labour, with neutrophils playing a pivotal role in preterm labour. These findings may guide the development of targeted interventions to prevent preterm birth.',

    title: 'Gender-Based Discrimination in Care Service Occupations: Result from an Online Experiment',
    summary: 'In this study, we conducted an online experiment to investigate the effect of masculine and feminine gender expression on hiring in care service occupations. Participants were presented with fictional hiring scenarios and workers’ profiles and photos, which were manipulated to appear distinctively masculine or feminine. For personal care services, we found that Asian masculine photo and Black feminine photo received the highest interview selection rates, while White feminine photo received the lowest. The typical gap was about 10–20 percentage points, equivalent to a 30–50% increase, and in the same order of magnitude as having one additional year of experience or having a community college degree. Our mediation analysis suggests that this effect was mediated by perceived gender expression and race and moderated by workers’ racial identity and the hiring occupation, but there are residual differences attributable to idiosyncratic features of the photos. While alternative explanations cannot be entirely ruled out, our findings are consistent with diminishing marginal return to masculinity and indicative that the social organization of care is not only gendered but also racialized.',

    title: 'Therapies for Advanced Parkinson’s Disease in Sweden: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Using Real-World Data',
    summary: 'Introduction The Swedish Parkinson’s Disease (PD) Registry provides rich data on cost and quality of life for patients receiving device-aided therapies (DATs) for Parkinson’s disease in Sweden. This study sought to use this real-world evidence to determine the cost-effectiveness profile of specific DATs in Sweden. Methods We developed a state transition (Markov) model to represent disease progression over time and used published clinical data to represent short- and long-term disease outcomes. We used data from the Swedish PD Registry to assign costs and quality of life measures (utilities) to each health state and modelled total costs and outcomes over a 20-year time horizon. The four treatment groups modelled were: best medical therapy, deep brain stimulation, levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel, and continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion. We calculated results from both payer and societal perspectives. Results The most cost-effective intervention was deep brain stimulation (DBS), which dominated all other interventions. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the key drivers of uncertainty were the transition probabilities between successive Hoehn and Yahr stages on each treatment. Results were consistent from both payer and societal perspectives. Conclusion DBS is a cost-effective use of resources in Sweden. However, uncertainty remains regarding long-term symptom control as well as quality of life within specific health states for all device-aided therapies, and further data are needed to fully validate the model projections and provide more insight into areas of future research.',

    title: 'Soil Water Balance and Productivity of Different Maize-Based Crop Sequences Compared to Rice–Wheat System under Contrasting Irrigation Regimes in North–West India',
    summary: 'An efficient management of water resources is considered essential for increased irrigation water productivity and for long-term sustainability of cropland ecosystems. In north-western India, the widespread adoption of conventional irrigation practices within water-intensive cropping systems like “rice-wheat” has led to frightening levels of water shortage and meager economic benefits. Diversified cropping systems, or producing different crops on the same piece of land at once, can increase revenue potential besides saving of irrigation water. Diversified cropping systems can help ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of agricultural operations, which can ultimately improve the livelihood of farmers. In this regard, this study aims to compare three maize-based crop sequences with rice–wheat system under different irrigation regimes. Specifically, rice equivalent yield, water balance, water productivity and net returns were assessed for different cropping systems under varied irrigation regimes. The study findings demonstrate significantly higher rice equivalent yield in maize– gobhi sarson– summer moong sequence under I 1.25 , I 1.0 and conventional irrigation scheduling practice besides saving of ~ 687.5, 462.5 and 800 mm of irrigation water, respectively, compared to the rice–wheat sequence established under conventional irrigation scheduling. The cropping sequence with oilseeds and pulses as component crops, i.e., maize– gobhi sarson –summer moong and maize–potato–mentha + onion has ~ 1.85-times higher water use efficiency under I 1.25 as compared to the R–W cropping under conventional irrigation scheduling. The R–W cropping sequence under conventional irrigation regime resulted in the lowest average net returns compared with maize-based crop sequences established under I 1.25 and the conventional irrigation regime.',

    title: 'Energy storage systems for carbon neutrality: Challenges and opportunities',
    summary: 'In recent years, improvements in energy storage technology, cost reduction, and the increasing imbalance between power grid supply and demand, along with new incentive policies, have highlighted the benefits of battery energy storage systems. These systems offer long life, low cost, and high energy conversion efficiency. While energy storage is gradually transitioning from demonstration projects to commercial operations, its technical and economic performance is still limited, and it lacks economies of scale. Research on the design and operational optimization of energy storage systems is crucial for advancing project demonstrations and commercial applications. Therefore, this paper aims to provide insights into system configuration and operational optimization. It first summarizes the optimal configuration of energy storage technology for the grid side, user side, and renewable energy generation. It then analyzes and reviews the economic optimization and cybersecurity challenges in power system operations. Finally, this paper discusses unresolved issues in energy storage applications and highlights important considerations for future implementation and expansion.',

    title: 'Trajectory of quality of life among patients with cancer at the end of life: a longitudinal survey study',
    summary: 'Purpose Measuring and understanding the determinants of HRQoL is essential to the delivery of effective and high-quality end-of-life (EoL) care to patients with cancer. Despite this, the evidence base remains sparse and with much of the existing literature relying on data from cross-sectional studies and clinical trials. Aim The objective of this study was to describe HRQoL in a population of patients with cancer leading up till death using both the generic preference-based scale European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level Version and the disease-specific scale European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. Methods Using a longitudinal prospective study design, HRQoL data was collected in four waves over the course of one year. The population consisted of all patients who received cancer-targeted drug treatment at the Department of Oncology at Odense University Hospital, Denmark. Only patients who died during the data collection period were included. Results HRQoL in patients with cancer was stable for most months and close to the level of the general Danish population at the same age but deteriorated considerably in the last three months of life. The same pattern was observed for both HRQoL scales. Conclusion Despite current efforts to deliver high-quality EoL care to patients with cancer, we see a general decrease in HRQoL in the months leading up to death. The generic and disease-specific HRQoL scales do capture different dimensions of HRQoL which also, by construct, are weighted differently in the two approaches.',

    title: 'Capacity planning in open-pit mines under economies of scale and block sequence considerations',
    summary: 'Capacity planning is a particular problem in the minerals industry because it depends on the heterogeneity and accessibility of the ore in the deposit, as well as on demand. If the ore is uniformly distributed within the deposit, capacity planning will be a function of project financing and demand. However, in many deposits, the ore is unevenly distributed, and it is not possible to access the ore as desired. Overlying ore and waste, considering slope angles, should be extracted earlier to access specific ore locations. Also, measuring the degree of EoS, the ratio of variable costs to total cost, called the “capacity factor,” also affects capacity planning. This research explores the critical relationship capacity planning, block sequencing, and economies of scale (EoS). By integrating EoS into a comprehensive cost-capacity relationship framework, a novel model that enhances traditional mine planning methodologies is proposed. A case study of an old gold deposit demonstrates the proposed model’s practical applicability. Results show that lower capacity factors (i.e., high fixed and low variable operating costs) for mining systems associated with large-capacity mining equipment significantly enhance net present value (NPV) compared to small-capacity equipment. On the other hand, the capacity factor for mineral processing systems has a less significant effect on NPV maximization when compared with the mining capacity factor. This emphasizes that the importance of EoS in mining systems is higher than in mineral processing systems. Even though the analysis suggests that the optimum capacity and the related NPV vary with different degrees of EoS, NPV is maximized with lower capacity factors for the mining system and moderate capacity factors for the mineral processing system. This observation highlights the critical need for accurate estimation of fixed and variable costs, as well as the degree of EoS, for a project.',

    title: 'Supporting Early Childhood Development through Multi-dimensional Service Delivery in South Africa',
    summary: 'There is a growing call to reduce environmental risk factors for children in LMICs and to provide children and parents in these places with the services they need to promote healthy development. In aid of this, we create an index of multidimensional service delivery for children in a developing country context. This approach is motivated by the consensus in the literature that early childhood development (ECD) is multidimensional in nature, and that children need multiple inputs at the same time for healthy development. The index is created using South African data, and shows that the full complement of the services is not adequately provided in any municipality in South Africa. Following on from this, a first validation is provided by assessing whether the constructed ECD services index is associated with individual child outcomes. The analysis reveals that the index is statistically significantly associated with child cognitive outcomes, and specifically, that public infrastructure service delivery is positively related to cognitive outcomes in children who attend an ELP in South Africa. This is consistent with the hypothesis that interventions which supplement child nutrition and the home environment have a larger positive impact than those which focus only on one element of development such as cognitive stimulation. This initial validation suggests that this index is useful to measure the compliment of services that children need to develop healthily.',

    summary: 'This study investigates the impact of unemployment, household income and expenditure, globalisation, and foreign direct investment (FDI) on child labour across 37 African countries from 2010 to 2021, employing panel and multiple linear regression models. The findings reveal diverse impacts: rising unemployment significantly increased child labour in countries like Ethiopia and Niger, while in Cameroon and Kenya, it had a negative effect. Globalisation’s influence varied, strongly reducing child labour in Ghana but exacerbating it in Burundi. Household income and expenditure generally reduced child labour, particularly in Ethiopia and Zambia. The effect of FDI was also mixed, decreasing child labour in Madagascar but increasing it in countries with weaker governance. These insights underscore the necessity for tailored, country-specific policies that consider local economic conditions and governance quality. Future efforts to combat child labour must focus on developing sustainable solutions that address these complex dynamics.',

    title: 'The Effect of Emotional Labour on Job Dedication Among Early Childhood Teachers in the UAE: The Mediating Role of Teaching Self-Efficacy',
    summary: 'Emotional labour is an important part of teaching. Teaching self-efficacy and job dedication are important parameters that influence teaching. Mixed findings have been reported on the link between emotional labour, teaching self-efficacy, and job dedication. This study examined the pattern of emotional labour performed by early childhood teachers, the relationship between emotional labour and job dedication, and the mediating effect of teaching self-efficacy on the relationship. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire survey from a convenience sample of 305 teachers from nurseries and kindergartens across the UAE. The mean comparison revealed that surface acting (M = 2.92) was performed significantly less frequently than deep acting (M = 3.90) and expression of naturally felt emotions (M = 4.19). Structural equation modeling with bootstrap mediation analysis revealed that expression of naturally felt emotions had a positive, direct effect on dedication (β = 0.43, p  = 0.012) and teaching self-efficacy (β = 0.84, p  = 0.002), and that teaching self-efficacy had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between expression of naturally felt emotions and job dedication, with an amount of indirect effect of 0.501 ( p  = 0.002) and mediating effect ratio of 54.10%. The implications of the results were discussed.',

    title: 'Are tailored primary care services for social inclusion good value for money? A health economics evaluation with Monte-Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis comparing tailored social inclusion primary care services to mainstream primary care services for socially excluded people.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Socially excluded groups of people (SEP) live with resources so inadequate that it precludes them from participating fully in the normal acceptable living standards of society. They often have complex health and social care needs yet face structural and attitudinal barriers accessing mainstream healthcare. This can result in ambulatory-care sensitive conditions being left untreated in the community and contributes to the higher use of costly acute services in crisis mode by SEP. Tailored social inclusion primary care (SIPC) services can provide a flexible approach to engage with and meet the needs of this marginalised population. There is little evidence on the economic benefit of these services from the perspective of the publicly-funded health and social services. The aim of this study is to conduct an economic evaluation (cost-consequence analysis) of a single-centre SIPC clinic in the Mid-West region of Ireland over a 12-month period and to determine its value for money. The analysis compares cost outcomes between SEP who have access to a tailored SIPC service with those who do not.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cost analysis of the part-time SIPC service, based on available Irish-sourced data on the usage and costs of acute care in the Health Service Executive (HSE), and a literature review were used to identify the cost and outcome parameters of the economic framework. A multi-variate probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation methodology was used to assess model uncertainty.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The cost savings of investing in the part-time SIPC service providing care to 292 individuals, were estimated to be €718,890.90 with an estimated 658 bed days saved over a 12-month period. This represented a return of investment of €3.71 for every €1 spent. The sensitivity analysis supported the estimates with just a 2.2% likelihood of a negative return of investment.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This study found that investment in SIPC services, that can meet the needs of a marginalised population, represents good value for money from the perspective of the publicly funded health service. The findings are valuable in supporting stakeholders, policy-makers, and budget holders to make evidence-informed equitable decisions for optimal funding allocation within health and social services.',

    title: 'Healthcare services for low-wage migrant workers: A systematic review.',
    abstract: "Low-wage labour migrants often face health-damaging living and working conditions, but are frequently excluded from healthcare. The othering of migrants, bordering of healthcare and simple oversight and negligence create widening health inequalities for a society's essential workers. This review aimed to identify the forms and effectiveness of healthcare services designed to make healthcare accessible for migrant workers. We searched for literature through Medline, Embase, Global Health, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus (from 1 January 2000 till 9 June 2023), focussing on selected work sectors (domestic work, construction, manufacturing, agriculture, mining). Primary research, reports, and grey literature from 2000 onwards containing descriptions or evaluations of healthcare services exclusively targeting low-wage migrant workers and their families were included. We excluded services focussing only on specific health conditions or disease screening. Quality appraisal was based on tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute. We narratively synthesised service characteristics and effects. This review follows the PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic reviews and is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023459360). Identified studies included 21 healthcare services targeting low-wage migrant workers in six countries (China, Dominican Republic, Italy, Qatar, South Africa, USA) in three sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, domestic work). Services included established medical facilities (e.g., general hospital care, semi-permanent primary healthcare (PHC) services); mobile clinics for PHC; and telehealth services. The healthcare services were provided by governmental, non-governmental, academic, and private actors. Most targeted migrant farmworkers and were primarily located in the United States. Common healthcare barriers were addressed, for example, via free care, outreach, or non-traditional hours. However, service effects on health, access and uptake, patient satisfaction, and acceptability were largely unclear, as only six studies offered some fragmentary evaluative evidence. Few healthcare services targeting migrant workers have been documented and evaluated, especially in LMICs. Although migrant workers are deemed to be mobile populations, once in the destination location, many are quite immobile when it comes to accessing healthcare. Thus, in the face of persistent exclusion of migrant workers, health systems cannot simply rely on the ability of this vital workforce to seek and use preventative or curative care, but healthcare services must be actively designed to be accessible to this mobile population in order to ensure health as a human right.",

    abstract: "PROBLEM: Labour induction rates are rising globally, with 25 % of all births induced today. Research on professionals' perspectives is limited. Few qualitative studies have been conducted, and none in the Nordic countries.\n" +
      'BACKGROUND: Some countries offer low-risk outpatient induction, allowing women without monitoring needs to await contractions at home.\n' +
      "AIM: To describe Swedish health care professionals' perspectives and experiences of low-risk outpatient and inpatient induction.\n" +
      'METHODS: A qualitative interview study was conducted at five hospitals participating in the randomised controlled OutPatient InducTION (OPTION) trial (EU CT No.: 2023-507,164-39-00). Focus group discussions or individual interviews were held with 20 health care professionals (midwives, obstetricians and auxiliary nurses) and analysed using qualitative content analysis.\n' +
      'FINDINGS: Four generic categories were identified: The woman is more central; The birth companion has a natural role; Strategies are needed to maintain safe care; and Health care resources are used more effectively.

    title: 'What is currently known about female genital mutilation and incontinence: a narrative literature review.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: An estimated 230 million girls and women are living with female genital mutilation (FGM) which causes ongoing physical and psychological harm. This review aims to explore what is known about FGM and incontinence, including the underexamined implications for women's health, and identify gaps in the literature.\n" +
      'METHODS: A comprehensive database search was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, APA Psych Info, AMED, Child Development and Adolescent Studies, and PubMed. To gather all relevant complications of FGM, no restrictions were imposed on date or study type. Themes were identified by organising the 20 eligible articles by symptom type.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The findings indicate that urological symptoms such as dribbling incontinence, slow micturition, urgency, stress incontinence and overactive bladder are prevalent among women who have undergone FGM. Additional complications include fistulas, pelvic organ prolapse, somatic symptoms, and urinary tract infections. The impact of FGM and incontinence on quality of life and daily activities remains under-explored, with the lived experiences of affected women largely unreported.\n' +

    title: 'Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome Practice Variation Across 31 Centres From 20 European Countries. An AEPC Imaging Working Group Study.',
    abstract: 'UNLABELLED: Despite significant advances in knowledge and the development of guidelines, the management of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) remains highly variable. A structured questionnaire was circulated across European Association of Paediatric & Congenital Cardiology (AEPC) affiliated centres. The aims were to evaluate standards in pre-operative assessment, types of surgery, follow-up and medical practices in children with HLHS. Thirty-one centres from 20 countries completed the survey. Delivery of babies with HLHS occurred in co-located maternity hospitals in 74% of centres; 29% were planned for spontaneous onset of labour, while 54% decided on a case-by-case basis. The preferred initial palliation was a right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit in 55% of cases, modified Blalock-Thomas Taussig shunt (mBTTS) in 35%, and hybrid in 15% of cases. Timing for Glenn varied from 3 to 6 months of age and preoperative examination varied greatly: 65% performed cardiac catheterization and only 19% performed cardiac magnetic resonance. Stage III palliation was performed at a highly variable interval (2-6 years of age), nearly always employing an extracardiac conduit. Fenestration was routinely performed in 61% and reserved for borderline cases in 39%. All the centers adopted warfarin for the first 3-12 months after Fontan completion, and continued if a fenestration was present, while in non-fenestrated aspirin was left by most centers (e.g. 68%). However, there was a high disparity in the use of heart failure medications (e.g. in interstage I-II 35% use ACE-inhibitors, and only 26% digoxin). Follow-up practice also varied widely with only 60% employing specific protocols.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION:  This first multi-centre European survey from 31 centres from 20 different European countries highlighted a high practice variation in HLHS management across all the stages of Single Ventricle (Fontan) palliation. Major variations pertained to pre- and post-surgical investigations, surgical strategy for stage I and III, medical treatment regimens, and follow-up programs.\n' +
      'WHAT IS KNOWN: • Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) remains one of the most complex and challenging congenital cardiac defects to manage. • Investigating the management of children with HLHS across different European centres can facilitate study of the most effective management strategies.\n' +
      'WHAT IS NEW: • Significant variation in HLHS management were reported in relation to pre- and post-surgical examinations, surgical strategy at stage I and III, medical treatment regimens, and follow-up programs. • Greater standardisation of imaging and diagnostic evaluation, medical treatment and follow-up surveillance may improve outcomes for these vulnerable patients and warrants further study.',

      'METHODS: Retrospective review of patients undergoing pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery by a single surgeon between 2016 and 2023. Patients were identified before and after the 2020 COVID pandemic as this marked a transition point where same day discharge became heavily emphasized. The historic cohort (group 1) represents patients admitted overnight with vaginal packing compared to those discharged home same day to remove their own packing (group 2). Healthcare utilization and complications were recorded in the first 30 days postoperatively.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were identified in group 1 and 39 in group 2. Age, BMI, and estimated blood loss was similar.

    title: 'Differences in gene expression patterns between parthenogenetically and sexually produced offspring during early development of Reticulitermes speratus.',
    abstract: 'Social insects exhibit reproductive division of labour, governed by both external and internal factors influencing caste determination. In termites with a unique reproductive system known as asexual queen succession (AQS), queens produce neotenic queens via parthenogenesis, while workers and alates arise through sexual reproduction. This inherent caste differentiation bias may have resulted from differences in gene expression potentially influenced by the parent-of-origin effect, as parthenogenetic daughters inherit only maternal genomes, while sexually produced daughters inherit both paternal and maternal genomes. Here, we show that gene expression patterns in developing embryos of the termite Reticulitermes speratus differ significantly between parthenogenetic and sexually produced offspring. However, SNP analysis indicated that these differences were not attributable to the parent-of-origin effect. Through RNA-seq analysis of female embryos post-katatrepsis, we identified 21 genes, including jhbp, nlk, and wge, which are known to be involved in caste differentiation and morphogenesis, with significant expression differences between parthenogenetic and sexually produced daughters. SNP analysis of sexually produced embryos did not reveal any parent-of-origin biased expression except for mitochondrial genes, though 12 genes exhibited colony-specific expression patterns. These findings suggested that early developmental gene expression partly explained caste differentiation biases. Further research is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind these transgenerational effects, providing insight into the evolution of AQS and complex caste determination in social insects from a gene expression perspective.',

    title: 'Molecular detection and identification of Trichobilharzia: development of a LAMP, qPCR, and multiplex PCR toolkit.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Cercarial dermatitis (CD), or swimmer's itch, is a water-borne allergic skin reaction caused by the penetration of the larval stages of bird schistosomes (cercariae) into the skin. Members of the genus Trichobilharzia are the primary causative agents of CD worldwide. Due to the increasing number of cases, CD is regarded as a (re)emerging disease. Outbreaks in recreational waters can significantly impact public health and local economies. Environmental monitoring of Trichobilharzia is crucial for outbreak prediction and public health management. However, conventional methods, such as cercarial shedding and snail dissections, are labour-intensive and lack sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, we present a molecular toolkit that combines loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and multiplex PCR for rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection and identification of Trichobilharzia spp. from various biological samples.\n" +
      'METHODS: Tricho-LAMP and Tricho-qPCR were designed and optimised for Trichobilharzia DNA detection. A multiplex PCR assay was also developed and optimised to identify the three main species causing CD in Europe (Trichobilharzia franki, T. szidati, and T. regenti).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Tricho-LAMP specifically detected T. regenti and T. franki at 10 ng, and T. szidati at 10 ng per reaction with genomic DNA. Using gBlocks synthetic DNA, Tricho-LAMP achieved 100% amplification at 10,000 copies and 85% amplification at 1000 copies, with decreasing success at lower concentrations. Tricho-qPCR showed the highest sensitivity, detecting all species down to 10 ng per reaction and showing a limit of detection at 10 copies of synthetic DNA in the reaction. Multiplex PCR allowed reliable species differentiation via gel electrophoresis of the PCR products, but the assay had the lowest sensitivity.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: We provide a molecular toolkit consisting of LAMP, qPCR, and multiplex PCR. By exhibiting high sensitivity, Tricho-LAMP and Tricho-qPCR assays are potentially suitable for environmental DNA (eDNA)-based environmental monitoring of bird schistosomes, by both researchers and public health authorities. Multiplex PCR can be used for species determination without the need for further sequencing.',

    summary: 'This paper empirically investigates the distributional effects of the UK carbon price floor (CPF) on households’ electricity expenditure. I employ the difference-in-differences model to analyse the impact of the carbon price floor on vertical inequality. The main result finds that households in the poorest quintile are most impacted by the electricity price increase. I further explore the heterogenous effect on households within the bottom quintile by considering various household characteristics. This paper contributes to the existing literature on carbon pricing policies, in particular their impact on inequality both across income groups and within households in the poorest quintile.',

    summary: 'This is an accepted article with a DOI pre-assigned that is not yet published.Outcome bias is a pervasive phenomenon in decision-making, referring to the tendency to evaluate decisions made under identical circumstances as more favourable when it results in the desired outcome. This paper analyses this cognitive bias in the context of top-flight European football, examining whether a Bayesian updating model distorted by a multiplicative outcome bias is valid. Managers make significantly more changes to their strategy following a loss than a win, even having controlled for expected performance, in-game performance, and team and game-specific variation. The results of this paper are consistent with a positive-outcome bias, but not necessarily a multiplicative bias.',
