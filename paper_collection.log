    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'The Role of Remote Activities in Urban Mobility in the Post-COVID-19 Era',
    summary: 'This study examines how remote activities, particularly teleworking and tele-education have been associated with urban mobility patterns in Greece during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing on shifts in travel behavior and attitudes toward future mobility trends, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 1,115 respondents, primarily from Thessaloniki’s academic community. The survey assessed mobility habits across three time periods (pre-, during, and post-pandemic), remote activity practices, future intentions, and socio-demographic factors. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were carried out to identify key determinants shaping future mobility and remote activity preferences. Results show significant behavioral changes, with walking, private vehicle, and bus use declining sharply during the pandemic. Prior to COVID-19, 80% of employees had no teleworking experience, yet 60% transitioned to working remotely five or more days weekly at the pandemic’s peak. Findings highlight strong support for continuing telework and remote learning post-pandemic, indicating lasting shifts in work, education, and urban mobility patterns.',

    title: 'Teaching Practices and Effectiveness Assessment of AI Courses Assisted by Large Language Models',
    summary: "This study explores the transformative potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational frameworks, focusing on the development and implementation of ViTA (Virtual Teaching Assistant), which is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4. Motivated by the need to enhance interactive learning and improve the relevance of course content delivery, ViTA is designed to provide real-time, adaptive support tailored to a course on machine learning and natural language processing. The deployment of ViTA aims to revolutionize student engagement and learning processes by offering intelligent, context-aware interactions. Utilizing a structured methodological approach, the impact of ViTA on student learning experiences was evaluated through surveys conducted before and after the course integration. These assessments focused on key areas such as student engagement, problem-solving accuracy, and the relevance of AI-generated responses to the curriculum. Statistical analyses using methods like the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and McNemar Test revealed that ViTA significantly improved learning efficiency and student interactivity. Despite the benefits observed, instances of response irrelevance highlighted the ongoing need to refine AI tools to better align with educational objectives. This study not only confirms the effectiveness of AI-driven virtual assistants in enhancing educational outcomes but also proposes continued advancements and deeper integration of AI technologies to enrich diverse learning environments.",

    title: 'The Effectiveness of 3D Virtual Environments for BPMN Teaching: A Quasi-Experimental Study',
    summary: 'Traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, being static and highly abstract, often hinder comprehension, particularly for novice designers and students. This can lead to misinterpretations and process inefficiencies. In this study, we investigate whether immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments can enhance the understanding of BPMN models. We developed a virtual reality (VR)-based BPMN visualization tool and conducted a quasi -experiment with 48 academic and professional participants, who interacted with a 3D BPMN model using Google Cardboard and a joystick. Participants completed comprehension tasks before and after the VR experience. The results show significant improvements in understanding and engagement, suggesting that immersive virtual reality can be a valuable educational tool for BPMN learning. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the integration of 3D environments in process modeling education, offering benefits for both academic and professional training.',

    title: '“Flipped” University: LLM-Assisted Lifelong Learning Environment',
    summary: 'The rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the landscape of lifelong learning. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for a self-constructed lifelong learning environment supported by LLMs. It highlights the inadequacies of traditional education systems in keeping pace with the rapid deactualization of knowledge and skills. The proposed framework emphasizes the transformation from institutionalized education to personalized, self-driven learning. It leverages the natural language capabilities of LLMs to provide dynamic and adaptive learning experiences, facilitating the creation of personal intellectual agents that assist in knowledge acquisition. The framework integrates principles of lifelong learning, including the necessity of building personal world models, the dual modes of learning (training and exploration), and the creation of reusable learning artifacts. Additionally, it underscores the importance of curiosity-driven learning and reflective practices in maintaining an effective learning trajectory. The paper envisions the evolution of educational institutions into “flipped” universities, focusing on supporting global knowledge consistency rather than merely structuring and transmitting knowledge.',

    summary: 'Wastes should not be wasted - it might be opportunities for a brighter future. That is the idea behind Waste4Knowledge, an IoT-driven kiosk that turns discarded items like plastic bottle aluminum cans into opportunities for children to learn and grow. The system incentivizes children to recycle waste materials by rewarding them with items, stationeries, or access to education contents. It uses IoT sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller to check the recyclables and hand out rewards without a hitch. Its modular hardware design, combined with Firebase software, allows real-time data tracking, enabling administrators to analyze recycling trends, adjust reward strategies, and optimize the user experience dynamically. By integrating recycling and education, the W4K system offers opportunities to underprivileged children, fosters environmental responsibility, and inspires positive community behavior. Its adaptable design positions it as a scalable solution for sustainable development initiatives worldwide.',

    title: 'AI as teacher: effectiveness of an AI-based training module to improve trainee pediatric fracture detection',
    summary: 'Objective Prior work has demonstrated that AI access can help residents more accurately detect pediatric fractures. We wished to evaluate the effectiveness of an unsupervised AI-based training module as a pediatric fracture detection educational tool. Materials and methods Two hundred forty radiographic examinations from throughout the pediatric upper extremity were split into two groups of 120 examinations. A previously developed open-source deep learning fracture detection algorithm ( www.childfx.com ) was used to annotate radiographs. Four medical students and four PGY-2 radiology residents first evaluated 120 examinations for fracture without AI assistance and subsequently reviewed AI annotations on these cases via a training module. They then interpreted 120 different examinations without AI assistance. Pre- and post-intervention fracture detection accuracy was evaluated using a chi-squared test. Results Overall resident fracture detection accuracy significantly improved from 71.3% pre-intervention to 77.5% post-intervention ( p  = 0.032). Medical student fracture detection accuracy was not significantly changed from 56.3% pre-intervention to 57.3% post-intervention ( p  = 0.794). Eighty-eight percent of responding participants (7/8) would recommend this model of learning. Conclusion We found that a tailored AI-based training module increased resident accuracy for detecting pediatric fractures by 6.2%. Medical student accuracy was not improved, likely due to their limited background familiarity with the task. AI offers a scalable method for automatically generating annotated teaching cases covering varied pathology, allowing residents to efficiently learn from simulated experience.',

    summary: 'In vocational education, the role of general education (GE) is pivotal in cultivating a well-rounded skill set among students. As the demands of the job market evolve, it becomes imperative to assess and enhance the efficacy of GE in these specialized settings. Vocational colleges (VC) and higher vocational institutions are essential in getting pupils ready for careers by offering specialized courses. However, the significance of GE cannot be overstated, as it provides a foundation for critical thinking, communication skills, and a broad intellectual perspective. This investigation aims to investigate the evaluation system of GE and related courses within VCs and higher vocational institutions. The study employs a descriptive mixed-methods approach. A purposive sampling technique was utilized to select participants. Using a questionnaire survey and interview method, the data for this paper was gathered from 157 teachers and 208 students. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS for statistical analysis. The findings identified that integrating technology-based evaluation methods enhances the effectiveness of GE programs in VCs. The result clarified that regular feedback and assessment in GE courses in higher VCs lead to better retention and understanding of the course content. The novelty of the study lies in assessing GE and courses in vocational and higher VCs, by exploring unique evaluation systems, it aims to enhance the quality of education, aligning curriculum with industry demands, and promoting well-rounded graduates in vocational settings.',

    title: 'Assessing the role of artificial intelligence in quality of legal education with special reference to sustainable development goal',
    summary: 'The transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly apparent in a variety of fields, including legal education. This study investigates the potential of AI in transforming legal education in order to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), 2030. As nations and cultures global struggle to achieve the SDGs, legal professionals play an important role in establishing legal frameworks that support progress toward these goals. It can improve the delivery of legal curricula by providing customized learning experiences targeted to individuals. AI can also help educators to create current content and enhance the evaluation. Education is now more dynamic, accessible, and affordable, expanding its reach. Quality of legal education is a cornerstone of achieving the SDGs set for 2030. The effective utilization of AI in the field of legal education holds significant promise in not only expanding access but also improving the quality of legal education. AI-powered legal research tools have the potential to revolutionize legal research for law students, researchers, and legal practitioners. They can provide more efficient and comprehensive ways to explore legal precedents, case law, and statutes, thus empowering legal professionals to perform their duties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By improving access to legal information, these tools can play a significant role in the formulation of laws and regulations that align with the SDGs. This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which AI can contribute to advancing legal education and, consequently, supporting the attainment of the SDGs.',

Das erste Ziel dieses Artikels ist es, die Konzeptionen von Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Schlüsselfaktoren zu analysieren, die zum Hochschulerfolg von 28 Absolvent:innen mit Beeinträchtigung aus 16 deutschen Hochschulen beigetragen haben. Das zweite Ziel besteht darin, Empfehlungen zu geben, die die Teilnehmenden selbst an andere Studierende mit Beeinträchtigung sowie an die Hochschulen richten, um ihren Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung zu verbessern. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Teilnehmenden unterschiedliche Konzeptionen von Erfolg haben (Erreichen eines Abschlusses, gute Noten, Erlernen und Entwickeln von Fähigkeiten, Sammeln von praktischen Erfahrungen, Überwinden von Herausforderungen und Aufrechterhalten eines Gleichgewichts zwischen Studium und Gesundheit) sowie verschiedene persönliche Faktoren (die Behinderung als treibende Kraft) und kontextuelle Faktoren (soziales und familiäres Umfeld, Auslandsaufenthalte, positives Feedback, Anerkennung von Leistungen und zugängliche Online-Kurse und digitalisierte Materialien) als relevant für ihren Erfolg identifizierten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ferner, dass es für den Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Stärkung von Studierenden mit Beeinträchtigung entscheidend ist, die Stimmen von Absolvent:innen mit Behinderung zu hören. While various researchers have explored inclusion and the educational success of people with impairments in recent years, the question of what the latter mean by academic success remains understudied. The first aim of this article is to analyse the conceptualisations of success in higher education and the key factors that contributed to the academic success of 28 graduates with impairments from 16 German universities. The second aim is to provide recommendations from the participants themselves to other students with impairments and to higher education institutions for improving their success in higher education. The results show that the participants have different conceptualisations of success (achieving a degree, getting good grades, learning and developing skills, gaining practical experience, overcoming challenges and maintaining a balance between studies and health) and identified various personal factors (the disability as a driving force) and contextual factors (social and family environment, time abroad, positive feedback, recognition of achievements and accessible online courses and digitised materials), as relevant to their success. The findings further demonstrate that hearing the voices of graduates with impairments is critical to their success in higher education and the empowerment of students with disabilities.',

    title: 'Do Caregivers of Asian Patients with Advanced Cancer Help or Hinder Patient Understanding of Illness and Involvement in Decision Making?',
    abstract: "PurposeIt is unclear whether caregivers help or hinder patients' involvement in decision making and understanding of illness. We thus investigated the extent to which caregivers' preferred level of patient involvement in decision making and understanding of treatment goals are associated with those of patients.MethodsWe used survey data from 229 patients with metastatic cancer and their family caregivers living in Singapore spanning 2 y prior to the patient's death. We used mixed-effects regressions to investigate the associations between 1) caregiver-preferred level of patient involvement () and patient preferred and perceived level of involvement in decision making at subsequent assessments () and 2) patient and caregiver understanding of treatment goals at the same assessments ().ResultsCaregivers who preferred higher levels of patient involvement in decision making at  were more likely to have patients who also preferred higher levels of involvement (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19;  = 0.03) and who perceived experiencing higher levels of involvement in decision making (OR = 1.24;  < 0.01) at . Compared with an uncertain understanding of treatment goals, caregivers who had an inaccurate understanding at  were more likely to have patients who had an inaccurate understanding (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 8.56;  = 0.03), and caregivers who had an accurate understanding at  were more likely to have patients with an accurate understanding (RRR = 3.02;  = 0.01) at .ConclusionOur findings suggest that caregiver preferences for patient involvement in decision making and understanding of treatment goals are significantly associated with those of patients. Enhancing caregiver education and involvement may be pivotal in improving patient participation and comprehension in the context of metastatic cancer care.HighlightsPatients of caregivers who preferred higher levels of patient involvement in decision making at earlier time points were more likely to prefer and experience higher levels of involvement in decision making at subsequent assessments.Patients of caregivers with an inaccurate understanding of treatment goals were more likely to have an inaccurate understanding, while patients of caregivers with an accurate understanding were also more likely to have an accurate understanding.",

    title: "Clinical Nurses' Experiences of Discrimination Against Patients: A Qualitative Study in Iran.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Any form of discrimination directly opposes the ethical principles and values of the nursing profession. Discriminatory care is a major moral challenge to healthcare systems around the world.\n' +
      "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore clinical nurses' experiences of discrimination against patients.\n" +
      "METHODS: This qualitative study used a conventional content analysis approach. Thirteen nurses were selected through purposive sampling from various clinical units at public and private hospitals in Iran. Data collection was conducted through semi-structured interviews, and data analysis was performed using Granheim and Lundman's 5-step method.\n" +
      `RESULTS: The study identified 3 main themes and 6 subthemes. These include "duplicity in the application of organizational rules" (comprising differences in providing hospitalization and patient accommodation services and ignoring organizational regulations in providing welfare services), "inequality in relationship with patients" (encompassing disregard for ethical considerations in patient relationships and differential physical presence at the patient's bedside), and "differences in the delivery of care and treatment services" (involving neglecting patients' needs in care provision and expediting the provision of interdisciplinary services).\n` +
      'CONCLUSION: This study underscores that discrimination in health care extends beyond direct patient care, infiltrating physical, material, and even intangible aspects such as communication style and patient attention. To combat this pervasive issue, nurses must receive comprehensive education about the various forms of discrimination. By implementing both immediate and long-term strategies, including policies and programs, we can work toward creating a more inclusive and respectful healthcare environment for all.',

    title: 'Nutritional myths in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes: a pilot study.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is steadily increasing, particularly among children and young adults. Health-related myths can significantly influence patients' dietary behaviors and treatment adherence, thereby compromising disease management and metabolic outcomes.\n" +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 190 adolescents and young adults with T1DM attending a pediatric endocrinology outpatient clinic. Data on demographics, BMI, HbA1c values, and nutrition-related myths were collected through face-to-face interviews. Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and Spearman correlation coefficients, were performed using SPSS 22.0 software. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent predictors of metabolic control status (p < 0.05).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Participants had a mean diabetes duration of 7.5 ± 4.63 years, with a mean HbA1c of 7.9 ± 1.44%. Approximately 27.0% of adolescents and 20.0% of young adults were overweight or obese. Only 29.0% of individuals had good metabolic control (HbA1c <%7), while 71.0% had HbA1c ≥ 7. An increase in diabetes duration was found to elevate the risk of poor metabolic control by 1.107 times, whereas a higher total number of answers was associated with a 0.696-fold decrease in this risk (p < 0.05).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Improved knowledge about nutrition myths is associated with better metabolic control among adolescents and young adults with T1DM. Structured education programs tailored to this population may contribute to improved glycemic outcomes. A multidisciplinary team approach is essential to effectively deliver educational content and reinforce evidence-based dietary practices.',

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Mobile apps show promise in supporting patients with heart failure (HF) in adhering to dietary guidelines for sodium and fluid. Though numerous apps to support HF management exist, only a few have dedicated features to support dietary adherence.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVES: To describe the process and outcomes from the development and testing of Sodium Navigator, a mobile app intervention to engage patients with HF in dietary education and adherence.\n' +
      'METHODS: Background research in app development, behaviour change, nutrition and qualitative interviews with patients and healthcare providers informed app content and design. Weekly team meetings were held to establish learning objectives, content, and features of the app until a prototype was developed and approved by the research team. Using a quasi-experimental mixed-methods design, patients with HF (≥ 18 years) evaluated the prototype via one-on-one online user-testing sessions. App engagement, satisfaction, and usability were measured using a 12-question patient-reported Likert-scale questionnaire. Participant feedback on app content and features was gathered using qualitative interviews.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Six educational modules (dietary sodium recommendations, contributors of sodium in the diet, nutrition labelling, lowering dietary sodium, fluid restriction and goal setting), ten behaviour change techniques (e.g., feedback on behaviour, social support) and gamified components (i.e., avatar, point-system) were integrated into the app. Participants with HF (n = 10, 56±15 years, 80% women) enjoyed using the app (90%), strongly agreed that the information was meaningful and useful for their general health (80%) and was easy to use (70%).\n' +

    title: 'Transgenerational transmission of eating disorders: the role of eating disorder symptoms and socio-cultural attitudes.',
    abstract: "OBJECTIVE: Eating disorders may be transmitted from one generation to the others through various trajectories, including genetic and epigenetic factors, parent-child relationships, and behavioral factors. In the current study, we examined whether parents' eating disorder symptoms and sociocultural attitudes toward appearance are associated with the diagnosis of an eating disorder or the level of eating disorder symptoms among female adolescents and young adults, and the nature of these associations. We also examined whether fathers' and mothers' effects on offsprings' eating disorder symptoms interact.\n" +
      'METHOD: The study included 65 triads of mothers, fathers, and their female offspring aged 11-22 (N = 195). Thirty-two offspring were diagnosed with an eating disorder and recruited from the in-patient eating disorder unit in a public hospital. The remaining 33 offspring, who formed the control group, were recruited via social media platforms.\n' +
      "RESULTS: In contrast to our expectations and previous findings, mothers' and fathers' levels of eating disorder symptoms and sociocultural attitudes toward appearance were negatively associated with their offspring's eating disorder symptoms. Also, inconsistent with mental health studies that showed that the behaviors and attitudes of one parent are exacerbated or attenuated by the other parent, we failed to find an interaction effect between mothers' and fathers' variables on their offspring's level of eating disorder symptoms.\n" +
      'DISCUSSION: The current study adds to the limited number of studies that focused on fathers in the transgenerational transmission of eating disorders and encourages further research on the effects of each parent and the combined effects of both in the development and maintenance of eating disorders in their offspring.',

    title: 'Factors associated with hospitalizations due to severe malaria in the non-endemic Brazilian region: a case-control study in the extra-Amazon Region from 2011 to 2019.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Malaria is infectious disease with low occurrence in Brazil extra-Amazon Region. Despite this, higher lethality is observed in this region compared to the country's endemic area. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse factors associated with malaria hospitalizations (severe malaria) in the extra-Amazon Region, in order to prevent deaths.\n" +
      'METHODS: A case-control design was used, utilizing data from the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System (Sinan) and hospitalization records from the Unified Health System (SIH/SUS) from 2011 to 2019. Cases comprised hospitalized malaria patients, while controls included reported malaria notifications without hospitalization. Probabilistic record linkage techniques were employed, and associations were analysed using multiple logistic regression with a 0.05 significance level.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The main risk factors identified were: Black or mixed-race ethnicity (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.04-1.43), low education (elementary school OR = 2.21; 95% CI 1.78-2.75 or high school OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.39-2.13), infection outside the extra-Amazon Region (Amazon Region OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.15-1.96 or abroad OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.28-2.32), high parasite count (501 to 10,000/mm OR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.27-1.80, 10,001 to 100,000/mm OR = 1.77; 95% CI 2.87-1.96 or higher than 100,000/mm OR = 3.15; 95% CI 2.20-4.50) and delayed treatment (after 3-7 days symptoms onset OR = 1.74; 95% CI 1.36-2.24 or 8 days or more OR = 2.08; 95% CI 1.62-2.66). Active case detection was a protective factor (OR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.54-0.78).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Delayed treatment remains a key factor in the occurrence of severe malaria, leading to high parasitaemia and revealing inequalities in access to healthcare based on socioeconomic differences. Travel to the Amazon Region or other countries also poses a challenge, requiring strengthened traveller health strategies and increased surveillance awareness to promptly suspect and identify cases.',

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Teaching and learning English for Medical Purposes is crucial for medical students, especially in non-English-speaking countries, as it facilitates effective communication, access to global medical literature, and participation in international medical events. However, medical English education faces numerous challenges. This qualitative study explores the challenges faced by medical educators and students in Iran and proposes strategies to enhance medical English education through technology and gamification.\n' +
      'METHOD: A thematic content analysis was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 13 medical English instructors and 10 medical students from various Iranian universities. Data were collected from September 2023 to February 2024. The interviews focused on challenges in teaching and learning medical English, the role of technology, and potential improvements. Thematic analysis was employed to identify key themes and sub-themes.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The study identified six main themes: (1) Instructor-related challenges (e.g., knowledge gaps, teaching methodology, and resistance to technology), (2) Student-related challenges (e.g., low language proficiency, pronunciation difficulties, and lack of engagement), (3) Curriculum and content issues (e.g., outdated materials, lack of speaking practice), (4) Organizational challenges (e.g., unclear policies, resistance to technological change), (5) Technology-enhanced learning (e.g., inadequate infrastructure, lack of interactive platforms), and (6) Recommendations for improvement (e.g., joint teaching, gamification, and blended learning).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The study indicated the need for a comprehensive approach to medical English education in Iran, emphasizing instructor training, interactive learning, updated curricula, and technology integration. By addressing these challenges, medical English education can be significantly improved, allowing future physicians to become proficient in linguistic skills which improves the globalized healthcare environment.',

    title: "Development of medical leadership competence during undergraduate medical students' final year - a cross-sectional cohort study.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Medical leadership plays an increasing role in quality healthcare. Nearly all physicians hold leadership roles during their career. Therefore, the development of medical leadership competence should start during undergraduate education and continue to postgraduate training. Some medical schools offer specific leadership programs, but in many medical schools, students are just embedded in the clinical environment, observing leaders in action. The goal of our cohort study was to explore how undergraduate medical students assess their leadership competences at the beginning and at the end of the final year without participation in a leadership program.\n' +
      "METHODS: Between November 2023 and June 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional cohort study with 112 students at the beginning (1 trimester) and 117 students at the end (3 trimester) of their final year. All participants assessed their leadership competence with the Medical Leadership Competence Scale (MeLeCoS) on a 5-point Likert scale (1: 'never', 2: 'rarely', 3: 'sometimes', 4: 'often', 5: 'always'). A t-test and Mann-Whitney-U-tests were calculated for the overall MeLeCoS score, for the six MeLeCoS factors, and the 37 items, respectively, to test for significant differences between both cohorts. Within both cohorts, factors were ordered according to their mean values. Wilcoxon-tests were calculated to look for significant differences between two adjacent factors.\n" +
      "RESULTS: No significant differences could be found between both cohorts for neither the overall MeLeCoS score nor for any of the factors or any item. In both cohorts, the factor 2 ('Demonstrating responsible behaviour and shaping relations') had the highest level in the self-assessment (1 trimester; 4.32 ± 0.40 and 3 trimester; 4.31 ± 0.36). Factor 4 ('Developing self-management and supporting management in healthcare') and 6 ('Introducing systemic perspectives into organizations') were the only factors that showed no significant difference in their adjacent mean values.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Given that there were no significant differences between both cohorts, including teaching of medical leadership into the final year is recommended. As some medical leadership competences are highly developed at the beginning of the final year, a medical leadership curriculum should start before the final year. Individual development could be monitored and reflected by self-assessment using the MeLeCoS.',
