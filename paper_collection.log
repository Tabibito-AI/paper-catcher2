    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    abstract: 'ABSTRACT In this paper we ask, what is mainstream economics education conveying to its students? Standard mainstream economics textbooks treat the environment as a specialist issue in addition to standard concerns and based on solutions that conform to those standard concerns. When viewed as socialisation for students this is a major problem. To illustrate the problems we set out key aspects of the standard format, and draw attention to the structure and contents from two well-known textbooks. Standard textbooks convey the impression that the ‘environmental issue’ is appropriately incorporated and exhibit two complacency-creating features. First, fundamental problems (acute global ecological breakdown, biodiversity loss, climate change crisis etc), issues and urgency cannot be adequately conveyed to students within this way of framing economics. Second, specific theory and policy solutions suggest that the problem is well in hand. We illustrate using the theory of negative externalities.',

    title: 'Developing a multi-layer agent framework to enhance AI-generated educational questions for cybersecurity',
    summary: 'This study evaluates the quality of questions generated by large language models, such as ChatGPT, in the context of cybersecurity education, using the CompTIA Security + certification as a case study. By analyzing 360 human-authored questions across 17 chapters and comparing them with AI-generated counterparts, the study employs Bloom’s Taxonomy to assess the cognitive levels achieved. The results reveal that AI-generated questions are predominantly limited to lower-order cognitive tasks, such as remembering and understanding, with significant gaps in addressing higher-order cognitive tasks, including applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. To address these limitations, a multi-layer agent framework was developed and implemented on a website. This framework integrates the ChatGPT API and processes the generated questions through multiple stages of evaluation, aligning them with Bloom’s Taxonomy and enhancing their quality. The framework includes scenario-based refinements, domain-specific fine-tuning, and a feedback mechanism to iteratively improve the cognitive depth of the questions. The agent systematically aligns AI-generated content with higher Bloom’s levels, making the questions more robust and applicable to real-world contexts. Evaluation of the framework demonstrates notable advancements in the quality of AI-generated questions, achieving closer alignment with human-authored content in terms of cognitive complexity, scenario depth, and relevance. The agent achieved substantial improvements in generating higher-order cognitive tasks, addressing the limitations of baseline AI performance. This study provides a scalable foundation for leveraging large language models in high-stakes educational assessments, with implications for adaptive learning and enhanced question design across diverse domains.',

    title: 'Exploring the interplay of religion and spirituality: an Islamic perspective on spiritual seeking and human existence',
    summary: 'This article explores the integral role of Islamic spirituality in addressing diverse life challenges, with a focus on the pursuit of meaning, purpose, and healing and its connection with Islamic education. It investigates how spiritual awareness within Islam aids individuals in coping with difficulties related to health, wealth, work, and family by providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and overcoming these adversities. Through an extensive literature review and synthesis of previous research, the study demonstrates that spiritual with seeking frequently arises in response to personal crises, establishing this quest for meaning as a fundamental aspect of spiritual development. Additionally, it highlights the role of Islamic religious education (IRE) in fostering resilience and moral integrity, equipping humans with the spiritual tools necessary to navigate life’s challenges. The discussion emphasizes how facing adversity can enhance one’s spiritual connection to God (Allah) and examines Islamic teachings on patience, gratitude, and perseverance. Additionally, the article analyzes the process of spiritual healing in the context of critical illness, highlighting how practices such as prayer, remembrance, and supplication offer psychological comfort and strengthen faith. By integrating the concepts of tazkiyat al-nafs (self-purification) and the holistic interplay between spiritual and physical aspects of life, the study portrays Islamic spirituality as a vital tool for personal growth and emotional resilience. Ultimately, it argues that Islamic spirituality provides a holistic approach to discovering life’s meaning, managing challenges, and achieving both temporal and eternal well-being. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the therapeutic potential of spirituality, particularly within Islamic contexts, and offers valuable insights for its application in contemporary settings.',

    title: 'The green potential of the digital economy in balancing economic growth and carbon emissions',
    summary: 'The imperative to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions is evident, given the escalating environmental challenges. The digital economy emerges as a pivotal agent for green solutions. Nonetheless, it is crucial to maintain a balance between emission reduction and economic growth, ensuring that efforts to curtail carbon output do not hinder economic development. This study aims to investigate the impact of digital economy on carbon efficiency across 287 Chinese cities from 2000 to 2021, based on benchmarks regression, threshold effect model, spatial effect regression, mechanism analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and difference-in-difference analysis. A key innovation of this study is the use of the Data Envelopment Analysis–Slack-Based Measure (DEA-SBM) model to measure carbon emission efficiency, addressing a major gap in existing research that primarily focuses on total emissions rather than efficiency. Compared with traditional efficiency measures, DEA-SBM captures the slack in both inputs and outputs, enabling a more realistic assessment of carbon efficiency under conditions of resource inefficiency and regulatory pressure in urban environments. Additionally, a structural equation model provides a multifaceted view of the digital economy’s influence on carbon efficiency, moving past conventional single-pathway mediation models. Empirical results show that a 1% increase in the Digital Economy Index leads to a 0.148% improvement in carbon emission efficiency. In high-GDP regions, this effect rises sharply to 3.624%. A mediation analysis further reveals that the digital economy also indirectly boosts carbon efficiency through economic growth, contributing an additional 0.47% improvement. These findings underscore the digital economy’s dual potential to foster both economic growth and carbon emissions. Based on the results, it is recommended that policymakers intensify digital economy development in undeveloped and resource-deteriorating regions, reduce taxes for green technology enterprises, and facilitate knowledge sharing from the more advanced eastern regions to enhance carbon emission efficiency.',

    summary: 'This systematic literature review summarises research on geometry education published since 2013. It begins with a conceptualization of the geometry education using the didactic tetrahedron model. The PRISMA guidelines were used to search five databases, in addition to conference proceedings and journals. The keywords and abstracts from the articles were analyzed using the “Voyant Tool” that created a list of the frequencies of words and their possible relationships to each other. Based on this analysis, the articles were coded using the didactic tetrahedron model. This informed the development of codes that were analyzed to develop categories related to the process skills Arguing and Reasoning, Proving and Reasoning, Problem Solving, and Modeling; the content skills Plane Geometry, Spatial Geometry, and Measurement, including Area and Volume; concepts that include Assessment, Gamification and Computational Thinking; and finally Teaching Competencies and Teaching Theories. The results of this overview show trends and developments that should be considered in geometry research in the coming years.',

    title: 'Fostering collaboration: a controlled pilot study of interprofessional education for medical and pharmacy students',
    summary: 'Background An increasingly ageing population and the resulting multimorbidity is a growing challenge for healthcare systems. A solution to tackle this problem is interprofessional collaboration. Interprofessional education, as an early meeting point, could foster a future successful interprofessional collaboration. So, the aim of our pilot study was to assess whether the “interprofessional collaboration between medical and pharmacy students to improve medication safety in polypharmacy” (PILLE) project changed the perception of medical and pharmacy students towards interprofessional collaboration. Methods PILLE consisted of three parts: (1) A mandatory 90-minutes interprofessional seminar; (2) A voluntary 120-minutes practical training; (3) A voluntary half-day interprofessional tandem work shadowing at a General Practitioner’s (GP) office. We used a controlled study design. Medical and pharmacy students from the intervention group attended the seminar (1). Medical students of the control group attended an interactive 90-minutes monoprofessional seminar only. Working together on cases was the similarity of both seminars. The students from the intervention group could attend (2) and (3). The outcome of interest was the change in students’ perception towards interprofessional collaboration after participating in PILLE, using pre- and post-questionnaires with the validated German version of Student Perceptions of Physician-Pharmacist Interprofessional Clinical Education (SPICE-2D) instrument. Descriptive and statistical evaluation was conducted. To assess if there is a significant pre-post-difference in the SPICE-2D overall score within the individual groups, paired t-tests were executed. To investigate if there is a significant change in SPICE-2D overall score difference between the medical students control and intervention group, an unpaired t-test was performed. Results In total, 436 students participated: 96 medical students and 116 pharmacy students in the intervention group, and 224 medical students in the control group. The participating students from both professions already had a pronounced positive perception at baseline. All pre-post-mean-differences within the individual groups and between the medical students control and intervention group were not statistically significant. Conclusion Participating medical and pharmacy students already had a positive perception at baseline. A one-time and short-term mandatory seminar of 90-minutes seems not to be sufficient to measure a change in perception. Future interprofessional education projects should focus on frequent meeting points between students.',

    title: 'Navigating the future of higher education in Saudi Arabia: implementing AI, machine learning, and big data for sustainable university development',
    summary: 'Higher education in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is going through big changes as universities try to meet the needs of 21st-century students and society. New technologies give both opportunities and challenges for Arab region universities to develop sustainably. This paper looks at ways to successfully use artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics in Saudi higher education while supporting long-term growth. First, it analyzes current trends in Saudi university enrollment, programs, and facilities to identify areas for improvement. It then explores the potential benefits of AI and big data, like personalized learning, better campus operations, and data-driven decision-making. However, there are also risks like high costs, privacy concerns, and lack of qualified people that need to be addressed. Recommendations are given for overcoming barriers to adopting these technologies including getting stakeholders involved, developing customized AI solutions, and starting tech-focused academic programs. The paper also discusses long-term impacts on faculty roles, student experiences, and financial sustainability. In the end, carefully implemented AI and big data can improve learning, and student services, and cut costs but require careful change management. By balancing cutting-edge tech with local needs, GCC universities can provide innovative education while upholding traditions and values. This study explores how AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data can enhance sustainability and effectiveness in Saudi higher education, aligning with relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals. Results highlight AI-driven insights that improve institutional decision-making and educational equity. Results indicate that among the predictive models tested, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy in student performance prediction, with an R 2 score of 0.85.',

    title: 'International Student Mobility and Its Impact on Destination Countries',
    summary: 'This article explores the impact of international student mobility on tourist destinations, specifically examining Erasmus students at Universidad de La Laguna in Tenerife. Recognizing the growing competition among Higher Education Institutions and the increasing economic importance of international students, this study addresses three main aspects: the factors influencing international students’ destination choice, their economic contribution, and their subsequent loyalty to host destinations. Through a comparative analysis of survey responses from 432 Erasmus students across two cohorts (2008–2012 and 2013–2019), the research finds that while academic reputation remains influential, students increasingly value the cultural characteristics, leisure opportunities, and affordability of the destination. Economically, international students provide substantial contributions to local economies via accommodation, food, and leisure expenditures, demonstrating broader regional economic benefits through their travel activities. The study also identifies high loyalty levels, revealing strong intentions among students to revisit their host locations, particularly as tourists, highlighting long-term economic and promotional advantages. These findings underline the dual importance of international students as both educational participants and valuable economic agents. The study contributes to the academic tourism literature by integrating the educational and tourism perspectives, highlighting the strategic need for enhanced collaboration between HEIs and destination managers. It emphasizes the importance of international students as economic actors and potential ambassadors, thereby providing a novel theoretical contribution by suggesting that strategies targeting international student attraction and retention should explicitly consider both academic and tourism-related factors.',

    title: 'Stimulating innovative learning practices with tech: artefacts influence learners’ actions',
    summary: 'Recently, there has been a transformation in the teaching and learning methods at universities, with nearly all higher education institutions using Learning Management System (LMS) platforms for course delivery and learning activities. These digital learning environments exhibit limited innovative learning methods, including a deficiency in appropriate artefacts and tools, as well as a lack of personalization and assistance. One of the reasons why Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) goal 4 is important is because it highlights the need to invest resources for advancement of educational tools and facilities towards sustainable development education. The literature indicates a lack of equilibrium between the functions of artefacts, actions, and pedagogy in the ever-changing technology-enhanced learning environment. Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationship between the adoption of artefacts and their impact on innovative learning practices. It integrates Vygotsky’s concept of mediating human activity through the use of artefacts, as well as two foundational theories: connectivism learning theory and growth mindset theory. The data for this quantitative study were obtained through survey. An analysis was conducted on a total of 350 questionnaires, resulting in 241 responses. The survey was conducted among undergraduate students who are currently enrolled at Prince Mohammad bin Fahd University (PMU). The data were analyzed using SmartPLS. Findings: This study addresses the clear correlation of artefacts actions on learners that facilitates innovative learning practices in the context of Saudi Arabia. Students’ innovative learning experiences are defined by their independence and are facilitated by tangible actions. Students valued the inclusion of creative artefacts that promote problem-solving, facilitate student-centered learning, and incorporate gamified components which is essential for scholarly communication within and beyond the classroom. It is important to note that the inclusion of artefacts should not be solely for the sake of showcasing innovation without any meaningful influence on digital acceleration. In order to assess the applicability of these findings, it is recommended that future research be conducted in higher education institutions (HEIs) in other regions of Saudi Arabia or other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Additionally, further investigation should explore the impact of integrating virtual reality and augmented reality as tools, as well as incorporating various pedagogical approaches to test the effectiveness of the innovation in the learning process.',

    title: 'Appraising Feedback Stance in Higher Education: A Corpus-Assisted Discourse Study of Student and Academic Perceptions, Perspectives and Preferences',
    summary: 'Feedback is a complex dialogic, sociomaterial practice that is shaped by digital affordances, institutional norms and various contextual factors. Even though it is widely recognised as crucial to academic development, student perspectives on the practice of feedback remain underexplored. This study examines appraisal strategies in social media discourse and academic writing by analysing the use of attitude, engagement and graduation markers in over 5,000 posts and comments on r/college and 100 research articles on feedback. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines advanced statistical modelling and qualitative appraisal analysis, the study identifies prominent register-specific patterns. Students’ reflections and comments are predominantly attitude-driven due to the prolific use of attitude markers and upscaling to engage in joint emotion regulation when processing past feedback experiences. This appraisal strategy encourages affiliative alignment and reflects the interactive and affective nature of online discussions. In contrast, academic writing is characterised by engagement-driven variation, with scholars employing contractive and expansive appraisal resources to negotiate disciplinary interpretations. Educational researchers favour entertain, appreciation and focus markers to evaluate conceptualisations and processes of feedback. The findings confirm the emotional impact of critique and reveal students’ preference for clear, empathetic, actionable feedback, while frustration arises from vagueness, unfairness or excessive criticism. Academics view feedback as a structured, discursive process that should be constructive, evidence-based and compliant with disciplinary norms, recommending transparency, justification and cultural responsiveness. Recognising the students’ standpoint and suggestions can inform the co-design of more effective feedback practices that combine emotional responsiveness and goal-oriented guidance for self-development.',

    title: 'Soft skills and the corporate social dimension: the perspective of university graduate employers',
    summary: 'Today’s job market is characterised by intense competition among young graduates with the same qualifications. Consequently, soft skills have become particularly important in the processes of attracting and recruiting talent because they allow improvements in productivity, innovation, and internationalisation within businesses. This study aims to determine the soft skills that Spanish employers demand most from university graduates within the Spanish context. More specifically, it seeks to provide evidence related to the demand for these skills according to variables such as Corporate Social Responsibility, employers’ social engagement, and candidates’ participation in non-formal education activities. To this end, a quantitative methodology was applied, using a sample of 83 employers from different businesses. The results show that the soft skills in most demand were related to interpersonal relationships, self-management, and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, there were differences in this assessment related to employers’ social engagement and graduate participation in non-formal education activities. The study has implications for higher education institutions’ strategies and for students’ academic and professional development, contributing to a better fit between education and business.',

    title: 'Association of the Campus Program Grant and Institutional Characteristics on Reporting of On-Campus Sexual Violence Crimes.',
    abstract: "The Office on Violence Against Women's Grants to Reduce Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking on Campus Program (Campus Program) grants provide higher education institutions with funding, technical training, and support to address sexual violence on college campuses. The aim of this investigation is to determine the association between the implementation of the Campus Program grants on reporting Clery Act Forcible Sex offenses (rape and fondling) and Violence Against Women Act offenses (domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking). A secondary aim is to examine the institutional characteristics related to incidents of reporting. The sample of institutions included grant recipients from fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017 with less than 10,000 students and a Carnegie classification as baccalaureate colleges or master's colleges and universities ( = 63). Linear regression models controlling for institutional variables were used to estimate the Campus Program grant implementation's causal effects on crime reporting from 2014 to 2021. The sample institutions experienced a significant increase in reports of rape ( = .003), fondling ( = .001), and dating violence ( < .001) during grant implementation years. In addition, all institutional characteristics used as covariates significantly affected one or more reported sexual violence crimes. Institutions should expect an increase in sexual violence reporting during the Campus Program grant implementation years. In addition, the study adds to the limited research on the institutional characteristics associated with sexual violence crime reporting. The results support that when addressing sexual violence, institutions need to consider the individual and campus-level factors, the inclusion of a diverse group of campus partners, and crime-specific interventions.",

    title: 'The Effectiveness of Affirmative Sexual Consent Cues.',
    abstract: 'Despite the growing literature related to sexual consent, most research has focused on female victims, indicating a significant need for more research focusing on consent and victim blame with male victims. The current study investigated whether male victims are blamed for sexual assault where the perpetrator is a female, using traditional sexual script theory as a framework. The study investigated whether participants could clearly differentiate between consent and non-consent scenarios when ambiguous nonverbal cues were presented. Participants ( = 167) were randomly assigned to one of three vignettes in a between-subjects experimental design: (a) A neutral control condition with no clear cues, (b) implicit nonverbal non-consent cues, and (c) explicit nonverbal non-consent cues. Participants were asked to rate consent and victim blame. Overall, the findings indicated that male participants placed more blame on victims and rated all scenarios (regardless of implicit or explicit cues) as more consensual than female participants. Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest that participants can identify non-consent, if any sort of cue (implicit or explicit) is presented. Nonetheless, participants believe that explicit cues, rather than implicit cues, would be the most effective method of communicating non-consent. These findings suggest that education campaigns may benefit from incorporating ambiguous non-consent cues in discussions about how consent is communicated.',

    title: 'Breaking the Silence: The Role of Screening in Physician-Initiated Firearm Safety Conversations.',
    abstract: "This article expands and investigates what physicians perceive as facilitators and barriers to initiating preventive health education, also called anticipatory guidance or medical education, around secure firearm storage in the home (safe storage) and outside the home (Emergency Risk Protection Orders [ERPO]). We employ in-depth qualitative interviews with 36 New Jersey physicians randomly selected from two national physician panels. Participants were screened for inclusions based on their specialty (family medicine or internist, obstetrics/gynecology, or pediatrics), practice setting (office-based rather than hospital-based), and time spent (80% or more) on direct patient care. Based on interviews, we identify five physician-perceived barriers to providing secure firearm storage counseling: inadequate screening mechanisms to prompt conversations, physician perceptions of who is at risk for firearm injury, time pressures, concerns about patient receptivity, and a need for physician training. Our findings indicate that there are structural barriers to physician-initiated firearm safety guidance. Interventions designed to increase physicians' willingness to have these conversations must first address why these conversations fail to occur. Physician participants expressed the need for revised patient screening tools, training on approaching conversations about secure firearm storage, and a mechanism to allocate sufficient time in a well-visit, among the many other topics they must discuss. Interview participants had minimal understanding of ERPO and how to counsel patients on petitioning for ERPO.",

    title: 'Diet Habits, Smoking, and Alcohol Consumption Among Chinese Patients with Cancer.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Cancer remains a significant public health problem in China, with new cases and cancer-related deaths increasing in recent years. This study examines the dietary habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption patterns among Chinese patients with cancer, and explores factors influencing these lifestyle behaviors.\n' +
      'METHODS: Secondary data analysis was conducted on a cross-sectional survey of 287 cancer patients from an oncology outpatient clinic in central China. Patients self-reported their current dietary habits, smoking, and alcohol use and recalled their habits prior to their cancer diagnosis. Responses were assessed using a Likert scale ranging from "never = 0" to "often = 3." The survey specifically measured the frequency of consuming red meat, seafood, milk, tofu, spicy foods, and "balanced yin-yang foods," as well as alcohol consumption and smoking. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and logistic regression.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Patients reported significant reductions in smoking and alcohol consumption post-diagnosis, with a 60% decrease compared to pre-diagnosis levels. Dietary changes included reduced intake of red meat, seafood, tofu, spicy foods, and milk, alongside increased adherence to a balanced yin-yang diet. Both Cultural/TCM beliefs and symptom-related factors significantly shape those lifestyle behaviors. The influence of TCM was particularly notable. Patients with strong TCM beliefs were associated with reduced alcohol consumption and decreased intake of seafood, tofu, and milk.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Following a cancer diagnosis, Chinese patients made significantnotable changes to their smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary habits; adopting healthier lifestyle behaviors. Oncology physicians and nurses should adhere to updated clinical guidelines on nutrition in cancer survivorship and integrate TCM principles to provide tailored lifestyle education and support.',

    title: 'Stepping Up Informed Consent: Navigating Foot and Ankle Orthopedics.',
    abstract: 'Orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons have an ethical obligation to obtain proper informed consent, ensuring that their patients are thoroughly educated about their diagnosis, risks, benefits, and alternatives of all possible treatment options. This study explores several critical aspects of the informed consent process in foot and ankle orthopedics, including: (1) its current state; (2) barriers that hinder the acquisition of adequate informed consent; and (3) potential solutions based on these identified barriers. The current literature suggests effective approaches to improve the quality of informed consent include using patient-appropriate language, standardized education materials, extended physician-patient visit times, and translation assistance. Utilizing plain language and supplemental materials, such as animated videos and standardized reading materials, enhance patient comprehension and decision-making. Integrating these methods with personalized patient-surgeon discussions results in optimal informed consent quality and patient satisfaction. Additionally, extended visit times, ideally 15 to 30 minutes, improve understanding, while interpreter services ensure clear communication for nonnative speakers. The findings of this study reveal significant deficiencies in the current informed consent process for foot and ankle orthopaedic surgery, which compromise patient autonomy. Implementing solutions to improve the quality of informed consent is necessary to protect patient autonomy and protect surgeons from litigation. IV.',

    title: 'Effectively Maintained Inequality in Canada Revisited.',
    abstract: `The mass expansion of higher education (HE) systems during the 20th century pushed social scientists to theorize how high participation systems continued to reproduce inequalities across socio-economic lines. One popular theory in sociology, dubbed effectively maintained inequality (EMI), suggests that families from the upper economic strata would maintain their competitive advantage by not only acquiring increasing amounts of education, but also gravitating toward the most prestigious tracks within HE. Despite the "flatter" status structure of Canada's HE system vis-à-vis international counterparts, this is a theory that has received empirical support from several domestic studies. Through this study, we re-examine the EMI hypothesis using the 2005 Ontario University Applicant Survey (OUAS), a little-known and thus far unexamined dataset that offers notable advantages relative to those historically analyzed in the Canadian EMI literature, including representative coverage of applicants to Ontario universities, holistic coverage of academic and demographic controls, and the ability to analyze both within- and between-sector forms of status-seeking. Our statistical analyses suggest that applicants from privileged socio-economic backgrounds behave in ways consistent with EMI, gravitating towards more prestigious HE options. We conclude by sketching a path forward for social stratification research in Canadian HE.`,

    title: 'Bridging Bioscience to Practice: The Significance of Clinical Simulation Training for Novice Nursing Students.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate clinical simulation as a learning method to enhance the relevance of bioscience in nursing practice for novice nursing students.\n' +
      "METHODS: This study utilizes a semi-experimental multi-method design involving 194 novice bachelor nursing students at a Norwegian university college, marking the program's inaugural simulation training. The students were divided into Group 1 and Group 2. Both groups underwent simulation-based training, but Group 2 received an additional extended debriefing where a bioscience specialist linked patient observations with physiological processes. Data collection occurred in two phases: quantitative data were collected on simulation day through a questionnaire and structured observation, and qualitative data from two reflection questions, supplemented with quantitative data from a questionnaire, were collected one week later.\n" +
      "RESULTS: The findings revealed that students' emotional states are highly activated during simulation training. Despite this, the students reported that their overall simulation experience was positive. A deficiency in the use of bioscience terminology was identified during debriefing to explain observations, assessments, and actions. The students' reflections on the benefits from simulation training showed that it provides them with practical experience in visualizing real-world scenarios, fostering readiness for action as a nurse, and metacognition of their learning process. Moreover, the findings indicated that students in Group 2 (extended debriefing) were more inclined to incorporate bioscience terminology in their reflective responses, particularly considering the impact of bioscience knowledge on nursing practice.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Clinical simulation training provides novice nursing students with clinical experience and an opportunity to connect bioscience with practice. Although the students insufficiently used bioscientific concepts during debriefing, they evaluated the relevance of bioscience in practice highly. Our findings carry significant implications for structuring simulation training, emphasizing the necessity of specialists in both debriefing techniques and bioscience to bridge the gap between theory and practice.',

    title: 'Three decades of neuroscience research using animal models of ADHD and ASD: a bibliometric analysis.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are two increasingly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), often accompanied by significant daily-life challenges. Animal models play a crucial role in studying these conditions, and recent advances have highlighted the potential of animal models such as mice, rat, zebrafish,  or  for investigating NDDs. However, despite growing interest, a complete understanding of these disorders has yet to be achieved. We believe that to properly address these NDDs, it is important to analyze the heterogeneity of ADHD and ASD research.\n' +
      'METHODS: This study comprehensively analyzes ADHD and ASD-related scientific publications from January 1990 to December 2023 using data from the Web of Science (WoS), exploring trends in global research output, impact factors, citation metrics, the predominant use of animal models, the contribution of major countries and funding information.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Out of the 10,844 papers from WoS, we curated 5,883 papers and identify mice and rat as the primarily used animal models, and a progressive use of zebrafish,  and  since the early 2000s. The countries conducting research on ADHD and ASD were principally the United States (3,059 articles), followed by China (487 articles), the United Kingdom (459 articles), Japan (440 articles), Germany (413 articles). We further show that impact factors and journal citations were relatively similar among the major publishing countries. Interestingly, key research funders were the National Institute of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and the Japanese Ministry of Education Culture Sports Science and Technology (MEXT), making important contributions to their respective countries' publications. Of note, Africa and Oceania have a lower volume of publication; however, our network analysis indicates a recent peak in research interest and ADHD/ASD awareness in some countries like Ghana or Portugal.\n" +
