    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'Mothers’ duties and rights when positioned as remote education tutors in Australian distance schooling',
    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Public management of digitalization into the Spanish tourism services: a heterodox analysis',
    summary: "This study is a critical review of public intervention and its management of change with digitalization, applied to Spanish tourism services, as ones of the largest case and most required of attention into the European Union. In comparison with other mainstream papers, this heterodox review is based on the combination of Austrian Economics and Neo-Institutional approaches ( Cornucopists ), with their common theoretical and methodological frameworks. Thus, it is possible to analyze failures and paradoxes in the public intervention, especially with post-COVID recovery policies. The case of the Spanish tourism sector highlights the effect of double bureaucracy, from European institutions and the Spanish Government, affecting its competitiveness and revealing the confirmation of heterodox theorems. Faced with mainstream public intervention guidelines, which usually involve expansive spending and more debt (and New-Malthusian measures), a heterodox mainline solution is offered here, based on the revival of the original sustainability principle, the readjustment effect and the promotion of geek'n'talent education, to facilitate the transition to the Knowledge Economy, where the tourism sector is capable of offering personalized travel experiences due to digitalization.",

    title: 'In pursuit of equity in upper secondary education: the curious case of Ghana’s free senior high school policy',
    summary: 'The Free Senior High School policy is Ghana’s attempt at actualising the SDG 4 global consensus on free upper secondary education. Using grounded theory method, this research scrutinises the Free SHS 2018 policy and strategy document, alongside interviews with policymakers, to answer the question: How does the equity provision ensure fairness in upper secondary education, and what equity blind spots exist? Specifically, the study employed a purposive sampling technique, allowing for the deliberate selection of data sources that ensured the collection of focused, meaningful data aligned with the research goals. The findings underscore a disconnect between the policy’s equity intentions and solutions. For example, the policy highlights that, intersectional differences—such as economic, school-based, gender, and regional factors—persist and drive inequitable access. However, these issues are inadequately addressed because the policy applies cookie-cutter-style economic solutions to all inequity concerns. Policymakers from within, and outside from government, hold diverse perspectives on the impact of this disconnect on sub-populations. The former underscores political and technical accountabilities where increasing numbers of enrolment are equated to equity, while the latter underscores differential policy effect sizes on sub-population to mean inequity. Curiously, the policy has improved access despite the equity conundrum, weak economy, lack of private–public initiatives, declining GDP allocation to education, no selective fee waivers, and neglect of secondary education expansion prerequisites. The paper advocates realigning the policy’s equity dimension with its equity goals.',

    title: 'A phenomenological reading of integration in the longitudinal integrated clerkship',
    summary: 'This paper reports on a phenomenological reading of integration in education programs, through three layers of specificity: (1) broadly, on integration as an educational idea; (2) more particularly, on integration as expressed in the program model of the longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC); and (3) with the highest degree of specificity, on integration ‘at work’ in an actual LIC program. Each layer of penetration found different aspects of the phenomenological nature of integration. A further integrative leap across these aspects phenomenologically revealed four essential qualities of integration, being: integration transforms parts into wholes; integration’s animating locus is mutable, mobile and multiple; integration is already at work and is sustained through possibility; and integration holds open for ‘more’ integration. By appreciating integration for its essential qualities, this research adds foundational value to the literature on educational integration, and opens new questions about how we, as educators, might deliberately work with both its presence and its promise in our educational pedagogies, practices and programs.',

    title: 'The positioning of quality and expertise in initial teacher education: policy enactment in the Australian context',
    summary: 'Teacher quality and teacher education improvement have been central discourses for at least two decades in global education. In Australia, despite the pervasive nature of these discussions, there is a lack of substantial evidence indicating the existence of a problem in this regard. Policies aimed at enhancing the ‘preparedness’ of teacher graduates and elevating the ‘quality’ of ITE programs have nonetheless emerged as prevalent solutions over the past decade. The latest enactment of reforms in the policy chain is the Strong Beginnings report from the Teacher Education Expert Panel. In this paper, we align with Ball’s perspective that policy should be viewed as a dynamic process rather than a presumed, ready-made solution to a problem. We utilise systematic conceptual coding using Leximancer to enable a nuanced exploration of the understandings, practices, and conditions of influence for the policy actors inscribed in the TEEP report. We also analyse concept frequency and collocation in the final Strong Beginnings report, noting two main propositions: first, that there is a problem with quality in ITE; and second, that practice is foregrounded in professionalisation. We highlight the consistencies and contradictions within the discourses of the final report and the submissions from policy actors that contributed to this policy enactment process. We suggest that evidence is used when it suits a policy position, but ignored if it disrupts the platform position. We conclude by arguing that the policy actors in this policy enactment process should be afforded the professional authority to continue a well-established process of continual improvement.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    summary: 'In this paper, we suggest that poetic inquiry offers a pathway for capturing the deeply felt, personal dimensions of ongoing identity growth of initial teacher educators of professional experience. We propose that poetic inquiry provides an avenue for authentically sharing experiences and insights into caring and being cared for, diverging from conventional academic narratives. Through poetic self-reflection and collective poetic representation, we can uncover and navigate the subtle tensions shaping our identity journey, fostering a communal understanding of the teacher educator’s role within the contexts of Australian higher education and initial teacher education.',

    title: 'Studying Year 6 students’ perceptions of gender and their engagement in STEM within an Australian primary school',
    summary: 'Gender stereotypes—and performances of femininity and masculinity—play a key role in how and why an individual engages in STEM education. Students’ perceptions of STEM have been carefully and consistently studied in high school and in tertiary education contexts, but to date there has been limited research examining students’ gendered perceptions of STEM at the primary school level. This small case study adopts a critical feminist approach and draws on classroom observations and semi-structured focus group interviews using photo-elicitation to foreground student voice. The aim of this research is to uncover how Year 6 students (n = 6) living and learning in Australia perceive STEM as a gendered discipline of study. Drawing on an inductive thematic analysis, we identified key differences between boys and girls which arguably have implications for their engagement in STEM. Our analysis foregrounds the role of (1) self-efficacy; (2) social pressures and performativity; and (3) pervasive gender norms, which all played a role in influencing students’ identities. We then consider the implications of these findings for educators. The article concludes with an examination of the limitations of the study as well as considerations for future research.',

    title: 'Distinct patterns of health risk behaviours in adolescents with thalassaemia.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Thalassaemia is a significant public health concern in Southeast Asia, yet little is known about health risk behaviours in adolescents with this condition. This study aimed to compare health risk behaviours between adolescents with thalassaemia and healthy controls, and to identify associated clinical and sociodemographic factors.\n' +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 60 adolescents with thalassaemia (aged 10-18 years) and 60 age- and sex-matched healthy controls in Thailand. Health risk behaviours were assessed using the validated Thai Youth Risk Behaviour Survey. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with risk behaviours.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Adolescents with thalassaemia reported higher rates of non-seatbelt use (25.0% vs. 1.7%,  < 0.001) and mental health problems (13.3% vs. 0.8%,  = 0.027) compared to controls. However, they exhibited lower rates of inadequate exercise (70.0% vs. 86.7%,  = 0.045) and excessive screen time (66.7% vs. 96.7%,  < 0.001). In the thalassaemia group, older age (aOR = 2.78, 95% CI: 1.09-7.09), female gender (aOR = 39.73, 95% CI: 0.89-1770.49) and lower pre-transfusion haemoglobin levels (aOR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01-0.64) were associated with increased odds of mental health problems. Higher pre-transfusion haemoglobin levels were associated with lower odds of violent behaviour (aOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.92).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with thalassaemia exhibit distinct patterns of health risk behaviours, influenced by age, gender and disease severity. These findings underscore the need for integrated physical and psychosocial care, highlighting the importance of tailored health education and interventions for this vulnerable group.',

    title: 'PTSD Symptoms change in response to a brief intensive trauma-focused treatment programme in non-veterans and veterans with war-related PTSD.',
    abstract: " Evidence suggests that veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are less likely to benefit from trauma-focused treatment than are patients with PTSD who have not been exposed to war-related trauma. However, new developments in PTSD treatment that combine several evidence-based trauma-focused therapies within a short time frame may help veterans achieve outcomes similar to those of non-veterans. In this retrospective cohort study, we examined changes in PTSD symptoms and diagnostic status after treatment between veterans and non-veterans. The treatment consisted of a four- or eight-day intensive trauma-focused treatment programme that integrated prolonged exposure, EMDR therapy, psycho-education, and physical activities. The sample consisted of 43 veterans and 43 non-veterans, matched based on age, sex, starting date, and duration of treatment. Participants were assessed pre- and post-treatment using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-5 (CAPS-5). The differences in CAPS-5 scores over time and between groups were modelled using Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVA. We performed Bayesian model averaging to quantify the differences in PTSD symptom changes between groups, based on treatment response, using the exclusion Bayes factor (). PTSD symptoms in both veterans and non-veterans decreased between pre- and post-treatment (Cohen's  = 2.17 and 1.54, respectively). Furthermore, we found moderate evidence of no differences in CAPS-5 scores between the groups ( = 4.8) or between the groups over time ( = 4.9). Although a greater proportion of veterans showed improvement according to the reliable change index than non-veterans (83.7% and 74.4%, respectively), there was no difference between the groups in terms of loss of diagnostic status after treatment (74.4% for veterans and 76.7% for non-veterans). This study provides evidence that veterans with war-related PTSD can benefit from brief intensive, trauma-focused treatment and does not support the notion that veterans need a different treatment approach in such settings.",

    title: 'Surface Pretreatment Protocols For Indirect/Semi-Direct Dental Restorations: A Cross-Sectional Survey and Expert Consensus.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate, via questionnaire, how protocols for adhesive luting workflows of dental restorations are applied in three German-speaking countries.\n' +
      'MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 47-item questionnaire gathered data on airborne particle abrasion (APA) unit characteristics, parameters, operating procedures, pretreatments in adhesive luting workflows for restorations, and participant demographics. The survey was distributed via trade journals, expert associations, universities, technical schools, and social media. Marginal absolute and relative frequencies were analyzed (95% confidence intervals), with Chi-squared tests comparing observed and expected frequencies (P0.05). Twenty-three experts voted on 23 recommendations regarding APA parameters and other pretreatments for bonding restorations.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 267 participants completed the survey. Access to an APA unit was linked to a higher likelihood of performing APA before placement. Approximately half of the participants used APA in their practice. For zirconia restorations, 47.2% applied alumina APA at 50 µm/0.1 MPa, while 36.7% used the same settings for polymer-based restorations. For alloys, 37.5% employed 110 µm/0.2 MPa. These preferences correlated with age (≥30 years), experience (≥10 years), profession (dental technician/dentist), prior instruction/training, and daily APA use. Adhesives with MDP were used for zirconia (63.8%) and those with silane for silicate-based ceramics (55.9%). Agreement on recommendations ranged between 52% and 100%, with 21/23 reaching an average of 93%.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Access to APA influenced clinical decisions and the feasibility of adhesive luting workflows. Adequate APA equipment in dental facilities is essential for quality care. Standardized protocols, training, and education across dental professions are necessary to enhance understanding and proper use of APA.',

    title: 'Motivational preferences of interdisciplinary family physician team members in delivering integrated care: a best-worst scaling study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In China, integrated care is facilitated by interdisciplinary Family Physician Teams (FPTs) to extend primary care services without increasing physician numbers. However, the advancement of integrated care faces challenges due to insufficient motivators for Family Physician Team Members (FPTMs).\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the motivational preferences of FPTMs within integrated care, highlighting preference heterogeneity across individuals with diverse demographic and professional characteristics.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in November 2022 with 363 FPTMs at community health centers affiliated with seven hospitals in Shenzhen city. The study assessed motivational preferences using a best-worst scaling (BWS) questionnaire to collect data. Conditional logit and mixed logit models were employed to analyze overall preferences and heterogeneity.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The study revealed a strong preference for patient-centered motivators, particularly highlighting patient needs, trust level, and adherence as key motivators that are crucial in shaping the engagement of FPTMs with integrated care. Additionally, heterogeneity in preference patterns was observed based on sex, education level, and professional role. Specifically, male FPTMs, those with a master's degree or higher, and general practitioners demonstrated a significantly stronger preference for employment benefits and government resource allocation.\n" +
      "CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the preference of FPTMs for patient-level motivators, underscoring the importance of implementing a feedback mechanism to capture patients' perspectives on services. Policymakers are urged to develop tailored motivational structures that consider the varied preferences of team members across different roles, thereby motivating the provision of integrated care by FPTMs.",

    title: 'Knowledge, attitude, and practice of kidney transplant patients regarding post-transplant complications: a cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The management of complications following kidney transplantation involves self-management, which requires adequate knowledge and favorable attitudes. This study explored the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of post-transplant complications among kidney transplant patients.\n' +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional study included (convenience sampling) kidney transplant patients from our hospital. A self-designed online KAP questionnaire was used for data collection.\n' +
      "RESULTS: A total of 499 (89.7%) valid questionnaires were included; 327 were filled out by men and 172 by women, aged 44.41±10.54 years. The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were 6.00±1.99 (possible range, 0-10), 22.29±1.96 (possible range, 6-30), and 29.28±3.78 (possible range, 8-40), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between attitude and knowledge (r=0.129, P=0.004), attitude and practice (r=0.334, P<0.001), and practice and attitude (r=0.416, P<0.001). Structural equation modeling showed that post-transplant complications and education were associated with knowledge while drinking alcohol, age, and duration since kidney transplant were negatively associated with knowledge. Knowledge and education were associated with attitude, while post-transplant complications were negatively associated with attitude. Attitude, knowledge, duration since kidney transplant and education were associated with the practice, while age was negatively associated with the practice.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant patients showed insufficient knowledge, positive attitude, and proactive practice regarding post-transplant complications. Age, education, drinking alcohol, post-transplant complications, and duration since kidney transplant might affect their KAP. Educational interventions targeting specific KAP items with poor scores should be designed and tested to improve the self-management of patients with kidney transplants.',

    title: 'Increasing Vegetable Intake Using Monosodium Glutamate in a Randomized Controlled Trial: A Culinary Medicine Intervention.',
    abstract: 'This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of monosodium glutamate (MSG) as a flavor enhancer in increasing vegetable intake compared to sodium chloride (NaCl) alone combined with a digital culinary medicine education program. A two-phase randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted from February to November 2023. Phase one involved a five-week intervention where participants received a designated seasoning and logged their vegetable intake using the MyFitnessPal app. Phase two involved a sensory evaluation, assessing the palatability of green beans and sweet potatoes seasoned with NaCl/MSG mixtures using a Likert scale and triangle tests to determine preference and palatability. Phase one; 60 participants were assigned to one of three groups: 100% NaCl (control), 50/50 NaCl/MSG, and 70/30 NaCl/MSG. Phase two; 88 participants and all seasoning groups received a digital culinary medicine education program with recipes and videos. The 50/50 NaCl/MSG group showed a mean increase in vegetable intake from 1.46 to 1.55 cups/day, while the NaCl group showed a decrease from 1.33 to 0.95 cups/day ( = 0.46). Preference tests indicated favorability trends for MSG mixtures, particularly with green beans seasoned with the 50/50 NaCl/MSG mixture ( = 0.07). Although the differences in vegetable intake were not statistically significant, the findings suggest that MSG could enhance vegetable palatability and intake, aligning with the principles of culinary medicine. This represents a promising strategy for improving dietary habits. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings.  Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT05591612.',

    abstract: 'Lifestyle Medicine Interest Groups (LMIG) have grown substantially since 2008, with 165 LMIGs established across the U.S. as of June 2024. The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) supports LMIG establishment within academic and health system settings, providing opportunities for students, faculty, and employees to learn about and practice lifestyle medicine (LM). A cross-sectional survey containing multiple-choice and free-text questions was administered continuously to established LMIGs between March 2020 and May 2023. Descriptive statistics were generated to note the number of unique institutions, median number of events, event attendance, and frequency of event types. Thematic analysis was conducted for all free-text sections of the survey. Data from 1,062 LMIG events across 127 unique institutions with a total of 29,689 attendees was analyzed. Each institution had a median of 5 events with a median of 16 attendees. Lectures, group physical activities, and board meetings were most common. Quantitative findings reveal substantial growth among LMIG events, expansion across geographic locations, and insights into funding sources. Nutrition and physical activity were most frequently highlighted, while social connection, sleep, and avoidance of risky substances were least represented. LMIGs are growing in number and size, empowering future health professionals through LM awareness.',

    title: 'Hidden in Plain Sight: A Scoping Review of Professional Grief in Healthcare and Charting a Path for Change.',
    abstract: "Healthcare workers frequently experience emotional distress from repeated exposure to patient death, yet professional grief remains poorly recognized and inadequately supported. The COVID-19 pandemic further magnified these challenges, bringing professional grief into sharper focus. The purpose of this scoping review was to comprehensively examine professional grief among healthcare workers (HCWs) across different professions and specialties, map existing literature, identify research gaps, and provide educational, clinical, and policy recommendations. This scoping review followed Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Databases searched included PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for literature from 2004 to 2024. Studies were screened based on inclusion criteria focusing on professional grief experiences of HCWs dealing with patient deaths. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method studies were included. Eighty-one publications were reviewed, with most studies published since 2020, highlighting increased attention post-COVID-19. Key findings identified significant individual (eg, early career vulnerability, lack of formal education), interpersonal (eg, patient demographics, relationship quality), and systemic factors (eg, emotional suppression culture, workload constraints) influencing professional grief. Existing interventions were predominantly peer-based and lacked demonstrated efficacy in reducing grief intensity. Measurement inconsistencies revealed discrepancies between qualitative and quantitative assessments of grief intensity, indicating a need for specialized measurement tools tailored to professional contexts. Professional grief among HCWs is multifaceted and deeply influenced by cultural, educational, and systemic barriers. Comprehensive strategies addressing these barriers must include structured educational curricula, ongoing clinical support programs, validated grief measurement tools, and institutional policies promoting open emotional expression. These approaches are essential to fostering resilience, enhancing professional well-being, and improving patient care outcomes.",

    abstract: "'Equity-focused care' has gained attention in recent years. With widespread use, concepts take on different meanings creating confusion for service providers. This study examines what people experiencing homelessness with life-limiting illnesses value in equity-focused care, and how service providers-who identify their work as equity-focused-describe their roles within a care system that relies on, yet often undervalues, this kind of work. We conducted 11 interviews with service providers and seven with people experiencing homelessness with a life-limiting illness and who received care from a community-based palliative care team in Western Canada. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed via thematic analysis. We constructed three themes: ; and . Themes aligned with two spheres of influence from the Education Training Research's Health Equity Framework:  and . Findings highlighted that service providers deliver equity-focused care by developing strong relational care networks challenging existing power structures -making this model incongruent with existing individually-focused biomedical care models. Findings transform the theoretical concept, 'equity-focused care', into tangible knowledge that highlights areas for policy change to support equity-focused care.",
