    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Analyzing the User Experience of Virtual Pedagogy in Architecture Education',
    summary: 'This study aims to analyze the user experience of virtual pedagogy in architecture education. It seeks to gather valuable feedback and perceptions from teachers and students regarding the effectiveness, challenges, and benefits of virtual pedagogy. The study employs a quantitative research design using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the user experience, challenges, advantages, and overall satisfaction with virtual pedagogy in architecture education. The findings reveal the widespread use of tools and applications, such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and Zoom etc., for delivering both studio-based and non-studio-based courses in the virtual learning environment. The study highlights several challenges associated with virtual pedagogy, particularly for studio-based subjects, including the lack of in-person experience crucial for effective learning, difficulties in providing hands-on training, discouragement of active learning, and inadequate access to specialized tools and software. Additionally, the findings indicate that while virtual pedagogy offers flexibility and accessibility, it faces challenges in replicating the spontaneous interactions and hands-on nature of traditional in-person design studios.',

    title: 'Exploring Practices for Implementing Smoking Cessation in Oncology Settings: A Rapid Systematic Review Update.',
    abstract: "IntroductionSmoking cessation among individuals with cancer increases the effectiveness of cancer treatments and reduces the risks of death. However, individuals receiving cancer treatments in Ontario's 14 regional cancer centres are provided advice on the benefits of quitting smoking and referrals to smoking cessation treatments at different rates. This rapid systematic review was conducted, with funding from the Canadian Cancer Society, to update a published systematic review (Young et al, 2023) and to (1) identify implementation strategies and related implementation outcomes used in oncology settings; (2) describe the characteristics of these implementation strategies and implementation outcomes; and (3) determine whether specific implementation strategies are associated with increased smoking cessation efforts, referred to as the 3As (Ask, Advise, and Act) approach to smoking cessation.MethodsThis rapid systematic review was registered in The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number CRD42023491391). Three databases were searched for relevant studies: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The quality of included studies was assessed based on their study design and narrative synthesis was used to summarize the data extracted.Results3158 studies were found, and eighteen new studies met our inclusion criteria. All eighteen studies had a low to moderate risk of bias. The implementation strategies training and educating stakeholders, using evaluative and iterative strategies, providing interactive assistance, supporting clinicians, and developing stakeholder interrelationships were associated with increased asking, advising, and acting, although these associations do not imply causality. Only 5 studies measured implementation outcomes; however, heterogeneity in the measurement tools used prevented analysis.ConclusionAlthough abundant data on implementation strategies was found, implementation outcomes were sparse and connections between the implementation strategies and implementation outcomes could not be drawn. Future studies should pilot the implementation strategies associated with increased asking, advising, and acting, and measure their success, considering both implementation strategies and implementation outcomes, as this information is lacking in the current literature.",

    title: 'Psychosocial impact of inherited arrhythmia syndromes on anxiety in paediatric patients and their families.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Inherited cardiac arrhythmias are life-threatening conditions associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death. These diseases impose a substantial psychological burden. Parents experience heightened anxiety due to uncertainty, medical interventions, and risk of adverse events. However, limited research has examined anxiety levels in affected individuals and their families.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess anxiety levels in children and adolescents diagnosed with inherited cardiac arrhythmias, specifically Long QT Syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia, and to identify factors influencing anxiety in both patients and parents.\n' +
      'METHODS: A prospective, survey-based cohort study was conducted between June 2023 and June 2024, including 53 patients (0-18 years) diagnosed with inherited arrhythmias. Anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Demographic and clinical variables, including disease type, invasive procedures, family history of sudden cardiac death, and parental education, were analysed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Mothers exhibited the highest anxiety (STAI-T: 46.6 ± 10.6) while fathers had the lowest (37.3 ± 7.0). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia patients reported significantly higher anxiety (49.2 ± 7.7) than long QT syndrome patients (38.0 ± 7.0,  < 0.01). Children undergoing invasive procedures, particularly sympathetic denervation, had elevated anxiety (45.1 ± 8.2 vs. 36.5 ± 6.4,  < 0.05). Mothers of male children and those with a family history of sudden cardiac death had significantly higher anxiety ( < 0.01).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Inherited arrhythmias significantly impact psychological well-being, with mothers experiencing the highest anxiety levels. Disease severity, invasive procedures, and family history of sudden cardiac death contribute to increased anxiety, emphasising the need for psychological support in managing these conditions.',

    title: 'When the earth shakes unexpectedly: impact on nephrology services and patients.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review examines the impact of earthquakes on nephrology services and patients, highlighting the urgent need for integrated disaster preparedness in renal care. With earthquakes increasing in frequency and affecting densely populated regions, the relevance of this topic to both clinical practice and policy has never been greater.\n' +
      'RECENT FINDINGS: Earthquakes disrupt dialysis infrastructure, impede access to care, and create surges in acute kidney injury (AKI) due to crush syndrome. Hemodialysis (HD) services are highly vulnerable to power, water, and transportation failures, whereas peritoneal dialysis (PD) offers greater resilience but faces hygiene and supply challenges. Special populations - pediatric patients, transplant recipients, and displaced persons - face unique vulnerabilities. Global experiences demonstrate that flexible modalities, patient education, and coordinated international responses can mitigate risks. Despite this, PD remains underutilized and disaster-specific planning is often lacking.\n' +
      'SUMMARY: Earthquakes expose critical weaknesses in nephrology systems but also provide lessons in resilience. Proactive strategies - including PD-first policies, interoperable patient registries, emergency kits, and mobile dialysis units - are essential to protect kidney patients during future disasters. Integrating nephrology into disaster frameworks is both a clinical imperative and a humanitarian necessity.',

    abstract: 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Children with kidney diseases are among the most vulnerable populations in disaster settings due to their age-specific physiological features, need for specialized care, and dependence on caregivers. This review highlights the importance of disaster preparedness tailored to pediatric kidney patients and proposes practical measures.\n' +
      'RECENT FINDINGS: Natural and man-made disasters continue to disrupt healthcare globally, often leading to poor outcomes in patients with chronic diseases. Despite international efforts, preparedness for pediatric kidney patients - including those with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis, those on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and transplant recipients - remains limited. Disasters frequently cause medication shortages, treatment interruptions, underdialysis, and increased risk of infection. Pediatric patients face unique logistical and clinical challenges, such as lack of age-appropriate dialysis supplies and trained personnel.\n' +
      'SUMMARY: Disaster preparedness strategies at the unit, regional, and national levels are essential to reduce risks and improve outcomes for pediatric kidney patients during disasters. These strategies must include pediatric-specific resources, trained personnel, caregiver education, and integration with broader emergency systems and official authorities. International nephrology societies and humanitarian organizations can also provide valuable support.',

    title: 'Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and the first 1000 days of life associated with obesity in Vietnamese preschool children.',
    abstract: 'Childhood overweight and obesity (OW&OB) have become major public health concerns worldwide, including in Vietnam, where rapid urbanization and lifestyle transitions may contribute to this trend. This study aims to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors, lifestyle behaviors, and exposures during the first 1000 days of life with OW&OB in Vietnamese preschool children. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 14 740 preschool children representative of three socioeconomic areas of Hanoi, Vietnam. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, and prenatal and postnatal factors were collected via parental and teacher reporting. Anthropometric measurements were recorded, and OW&OB were defined using World Health Organization standards. The generalized estimating equation model was used to examine associations. Factors found to be significantly and positively associated with both OW&OB include gestational weight gain >20 kg (OR*OW = 1.71, OR*OB = 2.05), birth weight >4000 grams (OR*OW = 1.90, OR*OB = 2.10), meal duration <20 min (OR*OW = 2.19, OR*OB = 3.49), preference for fatty foods (OR*OW = 1.48, OR*OB = 2.20), and bedtime snack (OR*OW = 1.39, OR*OB = 1.73). Place of residence, gestational age, delivery mode, and breastfeeding practice are also significantly associated with OW, but not with OB. The results of this study highlight the multifactorial nature of childhood obesity, emphasizing the need to focus on parental education, urban planning, and early-life nutrition as essential aspects to address this growing epidemic in public health interventions.',

    title: 'The Current Status of Medical Parasitology in Iran: Developing a Roadmap, Structural Mapping, and Proposed Scenarios for the Future of This Field.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We aimed to review and analyze the status of Medical Parasitology course including current problems and challenges on human resources, infrastructure, research capacities, educational and investigative priorities in Iran, and to develop a roadmap and future development in this field.\n' +
      'METHODS: A questionnaire was prepared to obtain information on Medical Parasitology departments in the country followed by field visits in many cases to collect data on the status of the faculty members, laboratory experts, physical spaces, laboratory equipment, microscopic slides, training Parasitology techniques, research projects and theses, published articles and books, access to Parasitology journals, books and e-books during 2022-2023. A roadmap and future development for Medical Parasitology in Iran and the formulation of a desirable status concerning short term to long-term goals was compiled.\n' +
      'RESULTS: While prominent strengths such as capable research laboratories, experienced faculty, suitable educational spaces, active research centers, the existence of centers for keeping and working with laboratory animals, international and national collaborations are seen in a number of medium to large centers, shortcomings related to expert human resources, lack of educational equipment and slides, the need to upgrade especially in practical subjects, journal clubs, and lab meetings, research infrastructure such as laboratory animal houses, budget for theses and research projects urgently need attention. Among 132 universities, faculties, and educational-research centers training personnel in allied medical sciences disciplines, a considerable number lack Parasitology specialists.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Iran has a strong foundation in Medical Parasitology. However, using non-permanent faculty paid per course in medical education undermines quality and strains resources, exacerbating shortages. Universities must implement tailored strategic plans for parasitology, regularly updated to strengthen education, research, and health services, ensuring sustained excellence in training and public health contributions.',

    abstract: 'Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability globally, with substantial socioeconomic impacts, including reduced productivity and increased healthcare costs. Most LBP cases are nonspecific and benign, but a thorough assessment is necessary to rule out serious underlying conditions such as infections, tumors, and fractures. This article reviews common etiologies, including mechanical back pain, degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis, and discusses both urgent and nonurgent spinal pathologies. Emphasis is placed on the role of non-operative spine clinics, which coordinate multidisciplinary care to improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary interventions and imaging. Conservative management for acute and chronic non-specific LBP focuses on patient education, exercise, and physical therapy. Evidence suggests that early education on spinal health and appropriate care pathways can significantly reduce surgery rates, enhance patient satisfaction, and improve long-term outcomes.',

This study aims to examine the impact of medical collaboration with schoolteachers on the management of NDDs. It is essential to evaluate how structured collaborations may enhance educational support and reduce teacher stress.\n' +
      'METHODS: A web-based anonymous survey was conducted from August to December 2023 among elementary and junior high school teachers across Ehime and Kyoto prefectures. Teachers completed an original questionnaire assessing their knowledge, attitudes toward students with NDDs, and responses to the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ). The survey categorized teachers based on their perceived effectiveness of medical collaboration. Logistic regression analysis, using 19 BJSQ subscales as independent variables, identified stress-related factors associated with collaboration effectiveness.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 812 valid responses were received, with 654 teachers reporting experience with medical collaboration. Among these, 249 teachers reported that collaboration was highly effective. The logistic regression analysis revealed that teachers who found medical collaboration effective had higher levels of qualitative job overload (odds ratio [OR]: 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.35,  = 0.02) and physical stress (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00-1.08,  = 0.04), but lower levels of interpersonal conflict (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.92,  = 0.002).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Teachers who perceived medical collaboration as effective reported lower levels of interpersonal conflict, suggesting a possible association between collaboration and reduced teacher burden. The findings support further integration of medical consultation in educational settings to better manage NDD-related challenges.',

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Pregnant women are at increased risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), with harmful outcomes for both mother and unborn baby. As this public health issue remained poorly documented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), this comprehensive study aimed to investigate prevalence and disparities of intimate partner violence during pregnancy (IPVDP) in 57 LMICs, grouped into WHO Regions and World Bank 2022 Income Classification. We also examined changes in IPVDP in LMICs and associated factors.\n' +
      'METHODS: Data for this study were extracted from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 57 LMICs from 2000 to 2024. Countries without domestic violence data were excluded from the study. We estimated overall, regional, sub-regional, and national-weighted prevalence of IPVDP among women aged 15-49 years. Trends in IPVDP were calculated at the national level using the average annual rate of change (AARC) in a subset of 31 countries with at least two survey rounds. A Poisson regression model was fitted for identifying factors associated with IPVDP.\n' +
      'FINDINGS: The study included a total weighted sample of 601,534 women. The pooled prevalence of IPVDP was 6.3% (95% CI 6.2-6.4). The Eastern Mediterranean region recorded the highest prevalence of IPVDP (11.3% [95% CI 10.8-11.9]), while the South-East Asia region (3.3% [95% CI 3.0-3.5]) the lowest. Similarly, low-income countries (LICs) reported the highest prevalence of IPVDP (8.2% [95% CI 7.9-8.4]). Further, prevalence varied greatly across countries, ranging from 1.1% (95% CI 0.6-1.5) in South Africa to 17.6% (95% CI 15.3-20.0) in Papua New Guinea. Examining AARC, most countries (23/31) experienced a decreasing trend in IPVDP, however, seven countries showed increasing trends, with the largest of 8.3% (95% CI 6.8-9.9) in Gambia and the smallest of 0.6% (95% CI -0.7 to 1.8) in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Similarly, we found that women: aged 15-19 years, from poor households, with primary education and below, who had more than 5 children, married before 18, who had not participated in household decision-making, and whose partners exhibited controlling behaviour had higher likelihood of experiencing IPVDP.\n' +
      'INTERPRETATION: Despite the implementation of numerous development programs aimed at reducing violence against women in LMICs in recent decades, IPVDP remains high in some countries and has even increased in others. Our findings indicate that efforts to reduce IPVDP and the associated health burdens need to be improved in many LMICs. In alignment with the 5.2 Sustainable Development Goal target (i.e., eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls), stakeholders such as NGOs and policymakers can use these findings to roll out interventions based on observed geographic and socio-demographic inequities to end IPVDP among vulnerable groups.\n' +
