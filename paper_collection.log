    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'Mothers’ duties and rights when positioned as remote education tutors in Australian distance schooling',
    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Public management of digitalization into the Spanish tourism services: a heterodox analysis',
    summary: "This study is a critical review of public intervention and its management of change with digitalization, applied to Spanish tourism services, as ones of the largest case and most required of attention into the European Union. In comparison with other mainstream papers, this heterodox review is based on the combination of Austrian Economics and Neo-Institutional approaches ( Cornucopists ), with their common theoretical and methodological frameworks. Thus, it is possible to analyze failures and paradoxes in the public intervention, especially with post-COVID recovery policies. The case of the Spanish tourism sector highlights the effect of double bureaucracy, from European institutions and the Spanish Government, affecting its competitiveness and revealing the confirmation of heterodox theorems. Faced with mainstream public intervention guidelines, which usually involve expansive spending and more debt (and New-Malthusian measures), a heterodox mainline solution is offered here, based on the revival of the original sustainability principle, the readjustment effect and the promotion of geek'n'talent education, to facilitate the transition to the Knowledge Economy, where the tourism sector is capable of offering personalized travel experiences due to digitalization.",

    title: 'In pursuit of equity in upper secondary education: the curious case of Ghana’s free senior high school policy',
    summary: 'The Free Senior High School policy is Ghana’s attempt at actualising the SDG 4 global consensus on free upper secondary education. Using grounded theory method, this research scrutinises the Free SHS 2018 policy and strategy document, alongside interviews with policymakers, to answer the question: How does the equity provision ensure fairness in upper secondary education, and what equity blind spots exist? Specifically, the study employed a purposive sampling technique, allowing for the deliberate selection of data sources that ensured the collection of focused, meaningful data aligned with the research goals. The findings underscore a disconnect between the policy’s equity intentions and solutions. For example, the policy highlights that, intersectional differences—such as economic, school-based, gender, and regional factors—persist and drive inequitable access. However, these issues are inadequately addressed because the policy applies cookie-cutter-style economic solutions to all inequity concerns. Policymakers from within, and outside from government, hold diverse perspectives on the impact of this disconnect on sub-populations. The former underscores political and technical accountabilities where increasing numbers of enrolment are equated to equity, while the latter underscores differential policy effect sizes on sub-population to mean inequity. Curiously, the policy has improved access despite the equity conundrum, weak economy, lack of private–public initiatives, declining GDP allocation to education, no selective fee waivers, and neglect of secondary education expansion prerequisites. The paper advocates realigning the policy’s equity dimension with its equity goals.',

    title: 'A phenomenological reading of integration in the longitudinal integrated clerkship',
    summary: 'This paper reports on a phenomenological reading of integration in education programs, through three layers of specificity: (1) broadly, on integration as an educational idea; (2) more particularly, on integration as expressed in the program model of the longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC); and (3) with the highest degree of specificity, on integration ‘at work’ in an actual LIC program. Each layer of penetration found different aspects of the phenomenological nature of integration. A further integrative leap across these aspects phenomenologically revealed four essential qualities of integration, being: integration transforms parts into wholes; integration’s animating locus is mutable, mobile and multiple; integration is already at work and is sustained through possibility; and integration holds open for ‘more’ integration. By appreciating integration for its essential qualities, this research adds foundational value to the literature on educational integration, and opens new questions about how we, as educators, might deliberately work with both its presence and its promise in our educational pedagogies, practices and programs.',

    title: 'The positioning of quality and expertise in initial teacher education: policy enactment in the Australian context',
    summary: 'Teacher quality and teacher education improvement have been central discourses for at least two decades in global education. In Australia, despite the pervasive nature of these discussions, there is a lack of substantial evidence indicating the existence of a problem in this regard. Policies aimed at enhancing the ‘preparedness’ of teacher graduates and elevating the ‘quality’ of ITE programs have nonetheless emerged as prevalent solutions over the past decade. The latest enactment of reforms in the policy chain is the Strong Beginnings report from the Teacher Education Expert Panel. In this paper, we align with Ball’s perspective that policy should be viewed as a dynamic process rather than a presumed, ready-made solution to a problem. We utilise systematic conceptual coding using Leximancer to enable a nuanced exploration of the understandings, practices, and conditions of influence for the policy actors inscribed in the TEEP report. We also analyse concept frequency and collocation in the final Strong Beginnings report, noting two main propositions: first, that there is a problem with quality in ITE; and second, that practice is foregrounded in professionalisation. We highlight the consistencies and contradictions within the discourses of the final report and the submissions from policy actors that contributed to this policy enactment process. We suggest that evidence is used when it suits a policy position, but ignored if it disrupts the platform position. We conclude by arguing that the policy actors in this policy enactment process should be afforded the professional authority to continue a well-established process of continual improvement.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    summary: 'In this paper, we suggest that poetic inquiry offers a pathway for capturing the deeply felt, personal dimensions of ongoing identity growth of initial teacher educators of professional experience. We propose that poetic inquiry provides an avenue for authentically sharing experiences and insights into caring and being cared for, diverging from conventional academic narratives. Through poetic self-reflection and collective poetic representation, we can uncover and navigate the subtle tensions shaping our identity journey, fostering a communal understanding of the teacher educator’s role within the contexts of Australian higher education and initial teacher education.',

    title: 'Studying Year 6 students’ perceptions of gender and their engagement in STEM within an Australian primary school',
    summary: 'Gender stereotypes—and performances of femininity and masculinity—play a key role in how and why an individual engages in STEM education. Students’ perceptions of STEM have been carefully and consistently studied in high school and in tertiary education contexts, but to date there has been limited research examining students’ gendered perceptions of STEM at the primary school level. This small case study adopts a critical feminist approach and draws on classroom observations and semi-structured focus group interviews using photo-elicitation to foreground student voice. The aim of this research is to uncover how Year 6 students (n = 6) living and learning in Australia perceive STEM as a gendered discipline of study. Drawing on an inductive thematic analysis, we identified key differences between boys and girls which arguably have implications for their engagement in STEM. Our analysis foregrounds the role of (1) self-efficacy; (2) social pressures and performativity; and (3) pervasive gender norms, which all played a role in influencing students’ identities. We then consider the implications of these findings for educators. The article concludes with an examination of the limitations of the study as well as considerations for future research.',

    title: 'A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) Tele-mentoring Program to Increase Clozapine Utilization.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: To determine whether a tele-mentoring program increases clozapine utilization by improving prescriber knowledge and perceived competence in clozapine management.\n' +
      'STUDY DESIGN: In a cluster-randomized controlled design, we tested the effectiveness of an Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model-based intervention, consisting of 26 biweekly didactic and case-based tele-mentoring sessions, vs enhanced treatment as usual (eTAU), in which both conditions received access to a consultation phone line and a point of care device for on-site hematologic monitoring. Prescribers completed baseline and 12-month assessments of clozapine knowledge and competence, and prescription records were used to evaluate the effects of ECHO on prescribing and treatment persistence.\n' +
      'STUDY RESULTS: 266 prescribers from 43 mental health treatment settings throughout Maryland were enrolled. Prescribers randomized to ECHO demonstrated a significant increase in clozapine knowledge compared to eTAU (P < .001), and competence increased significantly in those who attended 14 or more tele-mentoring sessions (P = .017). ECHO did not increase the likelihood of clozapine prescribing during follow-up (P = .70). While there was a 17% lower hazard of clozapine discontinuation among patients of prescribers randomized to ECHO, this did not reach statistical significance (P = .72).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: A statewide tele-mentoring program increased prescriber knowledge and competence in clozapine prescribing among those attending most ECHO sessions. Median time to clozapine discontinuation was double in the ECHO group, however, neither this nor rates of prescribing were statistically significantly different from control. Additional support is needed to motivate clozapine prescribing beyond providing education and increasing confidence in clozapine management.',

    title: 'Socio-demographic and attitudinal factors influencing household fruit and vegetable purchasing frequency in Eastern Türkiye.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: This study examines the relationship between households' fruit and vegetable purchasing frequency and their socio-demographic characteristics and attitudes, with a focus on Eastern Türkiye's Van province, a region underrepresented in existing literature.\n" +
      'OBJECTIVE: To explore how socio-demographic and attitudinal factors influence the frequency of household fruit and vegetable purchases.\n' +
      "METHODS: Methodologically, the research employs a Chi-square test of independence to compare households' fruit and vegetable purchasing frequencies across four categories: never, twice a month, once a week, and more than once a week. To further analyze the determinants of purchasing frequency, an ordered probit model was utilized. This econometric approach was applied to obtain coefficients used in calculating marginal effects and probabilities.\n" +
      'RESULTS: The empirical results reveal significant influences of various household characteristics on fruit and vegetable purchasing frequency. Household income, fruit and vegetable expenditure, employment and insurance status of the household head, perception of sufficient fruit and vegetable consumption within the household, and fruit and vegetable consumption by children in the household were found to positively affect the frequency of household fruit and vegetable purchases. Conversely, the age of the household head was found to negatively impact the frequency of fruit and vegetable purchases. Given the behavioral elements involved in food purchasing, this study also incorporates attitudinal and perceptual factors that may reflect bounded rationality beyond classical utility theory.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This research contributes to both public health and behavioral economics literature by integrating socio-demographic and psychological variables into the analysis of purchasing behavior. The findings suggest that multifaceted approaches may be necessary to effectively increase fruit and vegetable consumption, including economic interventions, educational programs, and targeted interventions for specific demographic groups such as older adults. The results also offer empirical support for developing regionally tailored strategies in under-studied areas like Van.',

    title: 'The Governmentalization of the Professional Gay Self.',
    abstract: `The idea of professionalism is dominated by men but there is a dearth of sociological studies about professionalism and sexuality and gender. Studies that examine how gay men see their professional selves is lacking, especially in the Philippine context. Unraveling how gay men see their professional selves is critical to contribute to the understanding of discourses on subject formation, from the subject themselves, in a particular social institution. This study drew data from in-depth interviews with 30 self-identified gay men from selected Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines. The narratives were examined under the lenses of Foucault's idea of governmentality. The study reveals that the concept of a "professional gay self" undergoes a governmentalization process. This process of subjectification involves influences from significant others namely the greater society, the family, and even from other Filipino gays-all laden with heteronormative discourses that allow the conduct of conduct to be possible.`,

    title: 'Comprehensive assessment of lower limb edema and its association with quality of life among men with prostate cancer.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Lower limb edema (LLE) is characterized by swelling due to fluid accumulation and is an under-recognized condition in men with prostate cancer. This study investigated the prevalence of LLE and explored its impact on daily living, depression, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\n' +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional study included men with prostate cancer who attended follow-up at the Department of Urology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, during a 3-month period. LLE was defined as an L-Dex ≥ 10, measured by using bioimpedance spectroscopy, combined with self-reported symptoms (≥ 2 of heaviness, swelling, or tightness) using items from European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC) QLQ-VU34. HRQoL, depression, and the impact of LLE on daily living were assessed using self-reported questionnaires.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among 401 patients, LLE was identified in 45 (11%) patients. Self-reported swelling before diagnosis, comorbidities, BMI ≥ 30, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) showed the highest odds of LLE. Patients with LLE demonstrated lower HRQoL scores in global health, physical, role, and social functioning and reported higher bowel and hormonal treatment-related symptoms (p < 0.05). LLE impacted daily activities, including walking (42%) and clothing choices (41%). Most patients (76%) wanted more information on managing LLE symptoms.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: LLE is prevalent among men with prostate cancer and is associated with poorer HRQoL and daily living. Despite its impact, many patients report a lack of information and express a desire for more knowledge about the condition. Improved patient education and attention to potential underlying causes are crucial for timely treatment of LLE.',

This review explores core behavioral economics concepts and their applications in HIV/AIDS prevention, including how salience bias, present bias, and loss aversion influence high-risk populations' behaviors. It also synthesizes empirical evidence on the effectiveness of nudge-based interventions in enhancing public health strategies, increasing HIV testing uptake, and improving treatment adherence.Additionally, the paper addresses key challenges in the field, such as interdisciplinary collaboration, cost-effectiveness analyses of economic incentives, and ethical and cultural considerations in implementation. Future research should further integrate sociocultural contexts specific to China to localize behavioral economics applications, refine intervention strategies, and optimize resource allocation. Such efforts will advance progress toward the global goal of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030.",

    abstract: " To understand the pathogen distribution characteristics of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in hospitalized children in the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Capital Center for Chlidren's Health, Capital Medical University from 2019 to 2023, and to analyze their epidemiological features.  A retrospective analysis was conducted, including 5 558 children aged 0-18 years who were hospitalized and diagnosed with ALRTI in the respiratory department of Capital Center for Chlidren's Health, Capital Medical University from December 8, 2019, to December 31, 2023. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were collected for pathogen detection.  Among the 5 558 ALRTI hospitalized children, the positive detection rate of pathogens was 81.81% (4 547/5 558). In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae had the highest detection rate (33.52%), while Streptococcus pneumoniae had the highest detection rate (24.38%) in upper respiratory tract specimens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (54.21%, =1 034.58, <0.001) and adenovirus (5.09%, =10.84, =0.013) were most common in school-age children, human rhinovirus was more common in toddlers (26.42%, =122.36, <0.001), and respiratory syncytial virus had the highest infection rate in infants (28.61%, =326.47, <0.001). A total of 52.06% of the children had mixed infections (2 367/4 547), with the highest proportion of mixed infections in infants (62.54%). During the post- non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) period, the proportions of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (69.88%  58.16%), human rhinovirus (30.37%  14.02%), adenovirus (51.16%  6.45%), influenza A virus (36.46%  16.67%), and mixed infections (33.33%  19.04%) in school-age children were significantly higher than during the NPIs period. In contrast, the proportions of respiratory syncytial virus (33.19%  19.42%), adenovirus (11.29%  4.65%), and mixed infections (17.75%  10.89%) in infants were significantly lower than during the NPIs period.  NPIs have changed the detection rate and epidemiology of respiratory pathogens in hospitalized children. After the end of NPIs, outbreaks of some pathogens may occur, so it is necessary to strengthen rapid pathogen detection, population surveillance, and health education.",

    abstract: ' To understand the consultation for post-exposure prophylaxis(PEP) services and their related factors among college students who were at high risk for HIV infection in Hangzhou,and to provide a reference basis for formulating an intervention model for college students at high risk of HIV infection.  A cross-sectional survey was conducted between November 2022, and March 2023, in 5 different types of schools in Hangzhou. The subjects should meet the inclusion criteria of age between 18 years and 24 years old self-reported having ever had sex in the past. The sample size was estimated at 864. An online survey was conducted among college students by questionnaire star of an online survey platform to collect their demographic information, sexual behavior characteristics, HIV test status, and consultation for PEP services. The HIV infection risk among participants was evaluated according to their sexual behavior. The consultation for PEP services and the related factors of college students who were at high risk for HIV infection were analyzed.  A total of 20 973 college students were surveyed, and 2 291 who have ever had sex were recruited in the study. The proportion assessed as being at high risk for HIV infection was 43.47% (996/2 291), and the proportion of consultation for PEP services was 9.24% (92/996). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that among college students who were at high risk for HIV infection, the positive related factors of consultation for PEP services included knowing about PEP services (a=17.49, 95%: 7.98-38.36) ,having HIV tests (a=3.92, 95%: 2.08-7.42) and access to condoms on campus (a=3.38, 95%: 2.02-5.65), and the negative related factor was homosexual orientation (a=0.24, 95%: 0.06-0.91).  Among college students who were at high risk for HIV infection, the proportion of consultation for PEP services was at a lower level. It is necessary to strengthen further the health education of PEP services knowledge among college students, improve the PEP services system, and promote the utilization of PEP services to reduce new HIV infections among college students.',
