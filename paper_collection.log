    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'The Role of Remote Activities in Urban Mobility in the Post-COVID-19 Era',
    summary: 'This study examines how remote activities, particularly teleworking and tele-education have been associated with urban mobility patterns in Greece during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing on shifts in travel behavior and attitudes toward future mobility trends, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 1,115 respondents, primarily from Thessaloniki’s academic community. The survey assessed mobility habits across three time periods (pre-, during, and post-pandemic), remote activity practices, future intentions, and socio-demographic factors. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were carried out to identify key determinants shaping future mobility and remote activity preferences. Results show significant behavioral changes, with walking, private vehicle, and bus use declining sharply during the pandemic. Prior to COVID-19, 80% of employees had no teleworking experience, yet 60% transitioned to working remotely five or more days weekly at the pandemic’s peak. Findings highlight strong support for continuing telework and remote learning post-pandemic, indicating lasting shifts in work, education, and urban mobility patterns.',

    title: 'The Effectiveness of 3D Virtual Environments for BPMN Teaching: A Quasi-Experimental Study',
    summary: 'Traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, being static and highly abstract, often hinder comprehension, particularly for novice designers and students. This can lead to misinterpretations and process inefficiencies. In this study, we investigate whether immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments can enhance the understanding of BPMN models. We developed a virtual reality (VR)-based BPMN visualization tool and conducted a quasi -experiment with 48 academic and professional participants, who interacted with a 3D BPMN model using Google Cardboard and a joystick. Participants completed comprehension tasks before and after the VR experience. The results show significant improvements in understanding and engagement, suggesting that immersive virtual reality can be a valuable educational tool for BPMN learning. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the integration of 3D environments in process modeling education, offering benefits for both academic and professional training.',

    title: '“Flipped” University: LLM-Assisted Lifelong Learning Environment',
    summary: 'The rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the landscape of lifelong learning. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for a self-constructed lifelong learning environment supported by LLMs. It highlights the inadequacies of traditional education systems in keeping pace with the rapid deactualization of knowledge and skills. The proposed framework emphasizes the transformation from institutionalized education to personalized, self-driven learning. It leverages the natural language capabilities of LLMs to provide dynamic and adaptive learning experiences, facilitating the creation of personal intellectual agents that assist in knowledge acquisition. The framework integrates principles of lifelong learning, including the necessity of building personal world models, the dual modes of learning (training and exploration), and the creation of reusable learning artifacts. Additionally, it underscores the importance of curiosity-driven learning and reflective practices in maintaining an effective learning trajectory. The paper envisions the evolution of educational institutions into “flipped” universities, focusing on supporting global knowledge consistency rather than merely structuring and transmitting knowledge.',

    summary: 'Wastes should not be wasted - it might be opportunities for a brighter future. That is the idea behind Waste4Knowledge, an IoT-driven kiosk that turns discarded items like plastic bottle aluminum cans into opportunities for children to learn and grow. The system incentivizes children to recycle waste materials by rewarding them with items, stationeries, or access to education contents. It uses IoT sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller to check the recyclables and hand out rewards without a hitch. Its modular hardware design, combined with Firebase software, allows real-time data tracking, enabling administrators to analyze recycling trends, adjust reward strategies, and optimize the user experience dynamically. By integrating recycling and education, the W4K system offers opportunities to underprivileged children, fosters environmental responsibility, and inspires positive community behavior. Its adaptable design positions it as a scalable solution for sustainable development initiatives worldwide.',

    title: 'AI as teacher: effectiveness of an AI-based training module to improve trainee pediatric fracture detection',
    summary: 'Objective Prior work has demonstrated that AI access can help residents more accurately detect pediatric fractures. We wished to evaluate the effectiveness of an unsupervised AI-based training module as a pediatric fracture detection educational tool. Materials and methods Two hundred forty radiographic examinations from throughout the pediatric upper extremity were split into two groups of 120 examinations. A previously developed open-source deep learning fracture detection algorithm ( www.childfx.com ) was used to annotate radiographs. Four medical students and four PGY-2 radiology residents first evaluated 120 examinations for fracture without AI assistance and subsequently reviewed AI annotations on these cases via a training module. They then interpreted 120 different examinations without AI assistance. Pre- and post-intervention fracture detection accuracy was evaluated using a chi-squared test. Results Overall resident fracture detection accuracy significantly improved from 71.3% pre-intervention to 77.5% post-intervention ( p  = 0.032). Medical student fracture detection accuracy was not significantly changed from 56.3% pre-intervention to 57.3% post-intervention ( p  = 0.794). Eighty-eight percent of responding participants (7/8) would recommend this model of learning. Conclusion We found that a tailored AI-based training module increased resident accuracy for detecting pediatric fractures by 6.2%. Medical student accuracy was not improved, likely due to their limited background familiarity with the task. AI offers a scalable method for automatically generating annotated teaching cases covering varied pathology, allowing residents to efficiently learn from simulated experience.',

    title: 'Tech-Enhanced Learning: Evaluating General Education in Vocational Colleges Through Technology Integration',
    summary: 'In vocational education, the role of general education (GE) is pivotal in cultivating a well-rounded skill set among students. As the demands of the job market evolve, it becomes imperative to assess and enhance the efficacy of GE in these specialized settings. Vocational colleges (VC) and higher vocational institutions are essential in getting pupils ready for careers by offering specialized courses. However, the significance of GE cannot be overstated, as it provides a foundation for critical thinking, communication skills, and a broad intellectual perspective. This investigation aims to investigate the evaluation system of GE and related courses within VCs and higher vocational institutions. The study employs a descriptive mixed-methods approach. A purposive sampling technique was utilized to select participants. Using a questionnaire survey and interview method, the data for this paper was gathered from 157 teachers and 208 students. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS for statistical analysis. The findings identified that integrating technology-based evaluation methods enhances the effectiveness of GE programs in VCs. The result clarified that regular feedback and assessment in GE courses in higher VCs lead to better retention and understanding of the course content. The novelty of the study lies in assessing GE and courses in vocational and higher VCs, by exploring unique evaluation systems, it aims to enhance the quality of education, aligning curriculum with industry demands, and promoting well-rounded graduates in vocational settings.',

    title: 'Assessing the role of artificial intelligence in quality of legal education with special reference to sustainable development goal',
    summary: 'The transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly apparent in a variety of fields, including legal education. This study investigates the potential of AI in transforming legal education in order to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), 2030. As nations and cultures global struggle to achieve the SDGs, legal professionals play an important role in establishing legal frameworks that support progress toward these goals. It can improve the delivery of legal curricula by providing customized learning experiences targeted to individuals. AI can also help educators to create current content and enhance the evaluation. Education is now more dynamic, accessible, and affordable, expanding its reach. Quality of legal education is a cornerstone of achieving the SDGs set for 2030. The effective utilization of AI in the field of legal education holds significant promise in not only expanding access but also improving the quality of legal education. AI-powered legal research tools have the potential to revolutionize legal research for law students, researchers, and legal practitioners. They can provide more efficient and comprehensive ways to explore legal precedents, case law, and statutes, thus empowering legal professionals to perform their duties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By improving access to legal information, these tools can play a significant role in the formulation of laws and regulations that align with the SDGs. This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which AI can contribute to advancing legal education and, consequently, supporting the attainment of the SDGs.',

    title: 'Die Konzeption von Erfolg aus Sicht von Absolvent:innen mit Beeinträchtigung: Schlüsselaspekte der Inklusion in der deutschen Hochschulbildung',
    summary: 'Während sich in den letzten Jahren verschiedene Wissenschaftler:innen mit der Inklusion und dem Bildungserfolg von Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen auseinandergesetzt haben, bleibt die Frage, was diese selbst unter Studienerfolg verstehen, weitgehend außer Acht. Das erste Ziel dieses Artikels ist es, die Konzeptionen von Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Schlüsselfaktoren zu analysieren, die zum Hochschulerfolg von 28 Absolvent:innen mit Beeinträchtigung aus 16 deutschen Hochschulen beigetragen haben. Das zweite Ziel besteht darin, Empfehlungen zu geben, die die Teilnehmenden selbst an andere Studierende mit Beeinträchtigung sowie an die Hochschulen richten, um ihren Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung zu verbessern. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Teilnehmenden unterschiedliche Konzeptionen von Erfolg haben (Erreichen eines Abschlusses, gute Noten, Erlernen und Entwickeln von Fähigkeiten, Sammeln von praktischen Erfahrungen, Überwinden von Herausforderungen und Aufrechterhalten eines Gleichgewichts zwischen Studium und Gesundheit) sowie verschiedene persönliche Faktoren (die Behinderung als treibende Kraft) und kontextuelle Faktoren (soziales und familiäres Umfeld, Auslandsaufenthalte, positives Feedback, Anerkennung von Leistungen und zugängliche Online-Kurse und digitalisierte Materialien) als relevant für ihren Erfolg identifizierten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ferner, dass es für den Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Stärkung von Studierenden mit Beeinträchtigung entscheidend ist, die Stimmen von Absolvent:innen mit Behinderung zu hören. While various researchers have explored inclusion and the educational success of people with impairments in recent years, the question of what the latter mean by academic success remains understudied. The first aim of this article is to analyse the conceptualisations of success in higher education and the key factors that contributed to the academic success of 28 graduates with impairments from 16 German universities. The second aim is to provide recommendations from the participants themselves to other students with impairments and to higher education institutions for improving their success in higher education. The results show that the participants have different conceptualisations of success (achieving a degree, getting good grades, learning and developing skills, gaining practical experience, overcoming challenges and maintaining a balance between studies and health) and identified various personal factors (the disability as a driving force) and contextual factors (social and family environment, time abroad, positive feedback, recognition of achievements and accessible online courses and digitised materials), as relevant to their success. The findings further demonstrate that hearing the voices of graduates with impairments is critical to their success in higher education and the empowerment of students with disabilities.',

    title: 'Supplementation Matters: Academic Impact of an Afterschool Tutoring Program in Timor-Leste',
    summary: 'Students in Timor-Leste face low educational outcomes due to sociopolitical factors rooted in the nation’s colonial history. This study evaluates the academic impact of a low-resource afterschool supplementary tutoring program designed to address learning gaps and improve school outcomes across rural and urban settings. Using instructional design principles, the program employed worksheet-based individualized learning content in a familiar language, supported by personalized feedback. Pre- and post-test scores in mathematics and English were compared over 7 months between an intervention group and a comparison group, with results analyzed using a Welch t test. Findings revealed statistically significant improvements in both subjects, with greater gains in mathematics, suggesting an opportunity to explore alternative methods for English instruction, such as incorporating social interactions to support early learners. The study highlights the importance of community support, tutors’ capabilities, and their residence within local neighborhoods in sustaining the program. These results demonstrate the potential of well-structured afterschool programs to enhance educational outcomes in low-resource contexts, offering a scalable model for similar initiatives in emerging nations.',

    title: 'Dietary Inflammatory Index: is it really associated with postmenopausal symptoms?',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Diet significantly modulates immunological responses and can impact climacteric symptoms. This study evaluated the association between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores and climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women.\n' +
      "METHOD: The study was conducted with postmenopausal women between May and July 2024. A face-to-face questionnaire including demographic characteristics, the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and the Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI) was administered. The DII score was computed based on dietary data. Anthropometric measurements were based on participants' self-reports. The data were analyzed using SPSS 24.0.\n" +
      'RESULT: s: In total, 193 postmenopausal women were recruited. Participants in T3, who had the highest DII scores and thus followed the most pro-inflammatory diets, had higher MRS and KMI scores, with significant differences between the groups ( < 0.001 and  = 0.033, respectively). T3 had higher intakes of energy and total fat ( = 0.018 and  = 0.030, respectively) but lower intakes of n-3 fatty acids ( = 0.038). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that moderate to high DII scores correlated with elevated MRS scores (odds ratio 1.100,  < 0.001 and 1.106,  < 0.001, respectively). After adjusting for age, marital status, education, employment, physical activity, year of menopause, supplement use and socioeconomic status, the results remained consistent.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: A pro-inflammatory diet might be associated with higher symptoms. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.',

    title: 'Alarm Fatigue and Stress Among Critical Care Nurses in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Alarm fatigue and stress among critical care nurses (CCNs) are critical issues that can adversely affect both nurse well-being and patient care.\n' +
      'AIM: This study aimed to assess alarm fatigue and stress levels among CCNs in Eastern Saudi Arabia, explore the relationship between these factors and identify significant demographic predictors.\n' +
      'STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional design was employed. The study involved 205 CCNs. Data were collected using a self-administered online questionnaire that included the Alarm Fatigue Scale (AFS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).\n' +
      'RESULTS: The mean overall AFS score was 24.68 (standard deviation, SD = 6.79) out of 52, indicating a moderate level of alarm fatigue. Approximately 58.5% of nurses experienced average alarm fatigue, while 11.7% reported high alarm fatigue. The mean overall PSS score was 21.4 (SD = 4.6) out of 40, indicating moderate stress. A total of 84.4% of nurses experiencing moderate stress, while 9.8% reported high stress. A weak, non-significant negative correlation was observed between alarm fatigue and stress (r = -0.131, p = 0.061). Regression analysis revealed that years of experience, age and educational level were significant predictors of alarm fatigue, with nurses aged 40 and above, those with diplomas and those with 1-5 years of experience reporting higher alarm fatigue. Additionally, nurses who reported recent stress and those with lower alarm fatigue levels showed significantly higher perceived stress.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The study reveals that moderate to high levels of alarm fatigue and stress are prevalent among CCNs, with key predictors including clinical experience, age, education level and recent exposure to stress.\n' +
      'RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: The study findings highlight the need for regular training on alarm management and stress reduction, investment in advanced monitoring systems to minimize false alarms and clear institutional protocols for alarm escalation. Stress management programmes, including mental health support and resilience workshops, are recommended to enhance nurse well-being and improve patient care outcomes.',

    title: 'Asserting Indigenous Academic Sovereignty Through Assemblage, Indigenization, and Cultural Safety.',
    abstract: 'Colonial academic institutions systematically marginalize Indigenous scholars and devalue Indigenous knowledge systems by privileging methodologies, epistemologies, and structures rooted in White-dominant cultural norms. This exclusion is a structural feature of what this paper terms . These systems persist in nursing education and research due to tenure and promotion criteria, Institutional Review Board protocols, publishing standards, and the underrepresentation of Indigenous faculty. These mechanisms function to suppress relational, land-based, and community-driven approaches fundamental to Indigenous ways of knowing. Focusing on nursing academia, we explore how Indigenous scholars can resist these systemic barriers through three interconnected strategies: assemblage, Indigenization, and cultural safety. We share how these strategies are applied across nursing education, research, and policy, enabling scholars to assert knowledge sovereignty while navigating institutional constraints. Assemblage allows for the selective incorporation of colonial tools into Indigenous frameworks. Indigenization aims to restructure institutions through Indigenous governance, ethics, and pedagogy. Cultural safety ensures these transformations are accountable to Indigenous communities. Together, these strategies challenge epistemic injustice and offer a model for transforming colonial institutions from within. By illustrating how Indigenous scholars lead these efforts, this paper contributes to global conversations on decolonization in health sciences and higher education.',

    title: 'Predictors of Neurodevelopmental and Mental Health Diagnoses in Congenital Heart Disease: A Danish Population-Based Cohort Study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Over 35% of Danish children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are diagnosed with or treated for a neurodevelopmental or mental health condition. We examined child clinical, parent socioeconomic, and family health factors associated with 4 common diagnostic groups in children with CHD: developmental disorders, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and anxiety and mood disorders.\n' +
      'METHODS: This population-based cohort study identified children aged <18 years with CHD from 1996 to 2017 by linking individual-level data across Danish health and social registries, excluding children with a neurodevelopmental or mental health diagnosis, by  codes, before the index date (ie, CHD diagnosis). Using age as a time scale, we computed cumulative incidence by the age of 18 years, incidence rates, and crude and adjusted hazard ratios for each diagnostic group. Hazard ratios were adjusted for child sex and year of CHD diagnosis. In addition, cumulative days in hospital were adjusted for CHD complexity.\n' +
      'RESULTS: In 16 473 children with CHD (male, 50.9%; median age at index date, 0.1 [interquartile range, 0.0-1.3] years), the cumulative incidence by the age of 18 years was 7.5% (95% CI, 7.0%-8.1%), 5.0% (95% CI, 4.6%-5.5%), 5.8% (95% CI, 5.3%-6.3%), and 10.3% (95% CI, 9.6%-11.1%) for these 4 diagnostic groups, respectively. Cumulative days in hospital within the first year after CHD diagnosis were the strongest clinical predictor of neurodevelopmental and mental health diagnoses, followed by sex, the presence of a genetic syndrome, and small for gestational age birthweight. Multiple socioeconomic metrics, including maternal or paternal age <25 years, low education (9-10 years), unemployment, and maternal marital status (eg, single or divorced), were predictors, particularly for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and intellectual disability. Maternal and paternal mental health diagnoses were predictors of all 4 diagnostic groups.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: We identified clinical, socioeconomic, and parent mental health factors associated with neurodevelopmental and mental health diagnoses in children with CHD. These data may inform early identification of these conditions and guide prevention and resource allocation.',

    title: 'Development of a pain management competency assessment for physiotherapy students: Integrating simulation and written assessments.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is a global challenge resulting in substantial healthcare costs. Despite its prevalence, gaps in pain management education persist across health professions education programs. Developing an assessment to evaluate student competency in pain management is essential to identify and address the potential impact of these disparities on learning outcomes. This study describes the development and initial evaluation of the Pain Education in Physiotherapy (PEP) competency assessment, aimed at assessing student level of competency in pain management across entrylevel physiotherapy (PT) programs.\n' +
      "METHODS: The assessment was developed using the DeVellis process, incorporating integrated knowledge translation principles and ongoing partner engagement. A steering group guided the creation of case-based multiple choice questions (MCQs) and simulation-based stations to assess competencies for pain management at different levels of Miller's Pyramid. Initial evidence supporting the validity argument was gathered from PT students in their final semester of education ( = 146 for MCQs;  = 53 for simulations).\n" +
      'RESULTS: Twenty-eight MCQ items and three simulation-based stations were selected. The MCQ component showed moderate internal consistency (α = 0.65), and the simulation-based assessments demonstrated moderate internal consistency (α = 0.63) with good interrater reliability (ICC range: 0.73-0.86).\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: The PEP assessment incorporates case-based MCQs and simulation-based assessment stations to address critical interpersonal skills such as communication and empathy, often overlooked in traditional written assessments. This approach fills gaps in pain management education and provides a more comprehensive assessment tailored to PT needs.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This assessment represents an important advancement in the assessment of pain management competencies. Its rigorous development process, partner engagement, and promising initial evaluation underscore its potential to identify gaps in pain education and help improve outcomes related to PT education.',

    title: 'Patient-Centered Care in Family Medicine: Strategies for Continuity and Comprehensive Care for Older Adults - A Mixed-Methods Study.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Patient-centered care (PCC) is a crucial approach in family medicine, particularly for older adults with complex health needs. This study evaluates the implementation of PCC strategies and their impact on health outcomes for older adults in family medicine settings.\n' +
      'METHODS: A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was conducted, involving 47 healthcare providers and 126 older adult patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Quantitative data were collected using structured surveys, while qualitative data were obtained through semi-structured interviews. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests, ANOVA, and effect size calculations to assess the impact of PCC strategies.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Healthcare providers identified continuity of care programs (48.9%) and patient education (44.7%) as the most effective PCC strategies. Key challenges included time constraints (74.5%) and lack of resources (59.6%). Patients in the high PCC implementation group demonstrated significantly better health outcomes, including lower hospital readmission rates (15.9% vs 36.5%, p=0.002), improved chronic disease management (87.3% vs 66.7%, p=0.014), higher adherence to care plans (82.5% vs 60.3%, p=0.008), and increased patient satisfaction scores (mean 4.6 vs 3.9, p=0.001). Qualitative findings highlighted key themes, including communication challenges, patient empowerment, and the role of multidisciplinary teams.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: PCC strategies significantly enhance health outcomes and patient satisfaction among older adults in family medicine. However, implementation barriers such as time constraints, resource limitations, and coordination challenges must be addressed. The study underscores the need for systemic healthcare reforms to improve PCC delivery.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This study highlights the benefits of PCC in improving patient outcomes and satisfaction while identifying barriers that must be addressed for effective implementation. Greater investment in PCC initiatives, improved healthcare coordination, and professional training are essential to enhancing care quality for older adults.',

    title: "Making their minds up: flux and stability in young children's career aspirations in North East England.",
    abstract: "School career information advice and guidance in England has typically focused on pupils aged 13-18. However, pupils aged under 11 have already formed career aspirations. Career aspirations are used as a proxy for future occupational destinations. This study tracks the individual career aspirations over 3 years for 78 children aged 7-9 at the start of study, from three schools in the North East England taking part in a STEM outreach project. The data are also used to explore the applicability of aspiration development frameworks for younger children. The majority of children were able to name at least one career aspiration with nearly 70% naming more, although these aspirations were drawn from a relatively narrow pool of jobs related to children's interests and jobs they see around them. 38% of the children had the same aspiration over time, but 60% of children changed their careers aspirations completely over the 3 years of the study. Career aspirations were strongly gendered, with boys naming a smaller pool of jobs most often. Between 2019 and 2021, there was an increase in STEM aspirations named by boys, and a decrease by girls. Thematic analysis of the reasons given for different aspirations identified four themes: self-actualisation, altruism, characteristics of the job, and role models. These themes were related to the aspiration frameworks. This study shows that there is both flux and stability in children's aspirations between the ages of 7 and 11. The gendered career choices at both time points indicate that there is a need for educators to challenge stereotypes about who can do what type of job from a much earlier age. All aspirations were drawn from a relatively small pool of job suggesting that introducing children to a wider range of jobs at an earlier age could support development of aspirations.",

    abstract: 'Prior to a fall semester graduate course in public health, students are encouraged to complete a summer reading assignment based on a book chosen from a curated list of popular literature relevant to public health concepts. From 2020 to 2024, this assignment enabled students to explore the history of structural and systemic racism in the United States and its impacts on current public health policy and programs. Themes from these books are woven into class discussions and further explored in subsequent course assignments. This paper describes the assignment and shares responses from the 1,141 students who completed the reading assignment as well as responses to subsequent assignments completed by the 1,464 students enrolled in the course. Scaffolding of complex and for some students challenging subjects facilitates a deeper understanding of factors critical to understanding contemporary public health challenges and helps students appreciate the significance of the social economic, and political determinants of health, including racism.',

    title: 'Health outcomes and care needs after osteoporotic fractures in rural Chinese older adults: policy implications.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic fractures pose a significant public health challenge among the older adult in rural settings with limited healthcare access. This study investigated the burden of osteoporotic fractures, associated care needs, and influencing factors in rural China.\n' +
      'METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2022 to December 2024, involving older adult individuals aged ≥60 years from rural regions of Enshi Prefecture, Hubei Province, as well as Shandong, Henan, Yunnan, and Gansu provinces in China. Participants were recruited via community health centers, with eligibility confirmed through medical records for osteoporosis or osteoporotic fracture history. A validated 33-item questionnaire assessed demographics, family support, health status, healthcare access, and policy awareness, with logistic regression analyzing factors associated with receiving help after fractures, adjusting for confounders.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among a total of 3,600 participants, 58.7% reported osteoporotic fractures, with 50.2% experiencing life impact, strongly linked to recent falls (93.2%,  < 0.001). Socioeconomic disparities were evident, with insured individuals (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.95-2.40,  < 0.001) and homeowners (OR 2.65, 95% CI 2.40-2.90,  < 0.001) more likely to receive help after fractures. Low policy awareness - defined as < 3 correct answers on a (0-6) Rural Health-Policy Knowledge Index - (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15-0.30,  < 0.001), and a high need for government support (90.1%) highlighted barriers to care. Medical interventions, including supplement use (OR 5.07, 95% CI 4.80-5.35,  < 0.001) and osteoporosis treatment (OR 4.51, 95% CI 4.32-4.73,  < 0.001), were significantly associated with increased odds of receiving help following osteoporotic fractures. Family support dynamics showed variability, with children helping after fracture reducing formal care access (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.95,  = 0.013).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Osteoporotic fractures impose a substantial burden on rural Chinese older adult, exacerbated by socioeconomic disparities and low policy awareness. Enhancing insurance coverage, health education, and access to medical interventions is critical to address care inequities and improve outcomes.',
