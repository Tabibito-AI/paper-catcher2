    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +

      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +

    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. These instructional strategies aim to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a tool that can promote substantive student involvement and meaningful learning. (An initial draft of this abstract was produced by ChatGPT 4.0, but GenAI was not used in any other way for this article, other than as an interactive partner within the excerpts as clearly marked.)',

    summary: 'This report details a set of three tasks used in an exploratory study of pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) experiences of task design for the mathematics classroom. The three tasks, which I call the Orange Dot Tasks , were constructed in Desmos, a dynamic geometry environment (DGE), and participants engaged each task through manipulating draggable objects on iPad touchscreens. The purpose of this report is two-fold: one aim is to present the tasks in detail and to elaborate on the intentions behind their design and a second is to present some perspectives of PSTs on these tasks generated through their participation in the study.',

    title: 'Making Tens with Four Hands: Touchscreen-Based Classroom Activity for Early Number Learning',
    summary: 'As schools increasingly embrace embodied learning, there is a growing need to incorporate classroom teaching and learning activities that recognize the body’s role as both an individual and collective resource for cognition and instruction. In response, we present a design for a classroom teaching sequence focused on early number learning, featuring pedagogical activities supported by TouchCounts (TC) and engaged by pairs of children using their four hands. These activities showcase the potential of embodied learning for children to explore concepts such as odd and even numbers, as well as the composition and decomposition of numbers up to and including ten. We elaborate on the functionalities of TC, outline the teaching sequence, and offer episodes of our classroom observations. Specifically, we present three lesson snapshots aimed at first-graders (aged 6 to 7) using a class set of TC, student learning outcomes, and notable observations as students interact with the touchscreen environment. For example, we note that the student pairs used their hands to reinforce, extend, and redirect mathematical ideas; besides, they developed a collective discourse through (gestural) subitizing the number of fingers that they (and their partner) put up (and folded down). This snapshot explicates the collective learning experiences in classroom settings involving pair-work activities and informs existing work on embodied (mathematical) cognition beyond how students learn with their bodies individually.',

    title: 'Understanding Children’s Learning of Part–Whole Relations Using Fingu',
    summary: 'In this article, we investigate the effects of the app Fingu on a child’s understanding of the part-whole concept. Using the Artifact Centric Activity Theory framework, we initially analyse the internalisation and externalisation processes that appear to occur during one child’s use of the app. Based on the learning from this process, we then use other aspects of the framework, in particular the subject-artifact-group triangle, to understand how Fingu might be used productively in mathematics education classrooms. Using a 13-min video of a child playing Fingu as our data source, we analyse how children might, as they learn about part-whole relationships, interact with the game. We also investigate how design principles in creating apps can impact on the experience of using the app in ways that may be unintended by their designers. This work has implications for app designers and for mathematics educators seeking to incorporate digital technologies into mathematics education.',

    title: 'Mothers’ duties and rights when positioned as remote education tutors in Australian distance schooling',
    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Art and design teachers’ personal rules of thumb while designing instruction for studios',
    summary: "In higher vocational education, innovations are shifting from teacher-oriented to student-oriented education and hybrid learning environments. Designing these innovative environments is complex. This study aimed to gain insight into art and design teachers’ rules of thumb when designing instruction in studios. The rules of thumb from experienced designers of design education provide insight into the practical knowledge essential for creating effective studio learning environments. These rules of thumb, derived from teachers' practical knowledge, outline teachers’ ideas about characteristics design education should have to achieve specific student learning outcomes. Six teachers participated in this case study, to investigate this phenomenon in a real-world context. During interviews, they designed a studio for their teaching practice while thinking aloud, expressing their thoughts, actions, and reasoning. These teachers had at least four years of experience in designing art and design studios and were still active in their roles. Within and cross-case analysis revealed that learning theories are recognizable in teachers’ rules of thumb when designing studio instruction. Teachers and their rules of thumb span a spectrum from cognitivism to social constructivism, with most teachers oriented towards social constructivism. This aligns with strategic design considerations at studios, which are also based on social constructivism. Typical social-constructivist rules of thumb focus on student ownership of their learning process and fostering collaboration between various actors in an authentic context. The rules of thumb from experienced designers are incorporated into the training of current and future studio designers and may inspire those who create similar innovative learning environments.",

    summary: 'Design thinking is a cognitive, iterative process that involves identifying goals, understanding users, and creating solutions. It has changed from a designers’ activity to an all-around approach to the innovation process and become a pedagogical phenomenon. In this article, design thinking method is studied in an educational context among young learners (children aged 5–8) through a literature review. The aim of this review is to gain an understanding of the reasons why and the ways in which design thinking is applied as an educational method in early childhood education and care. Through the review, we aim to find new ideas for teaching craft, design, and technology education with young learners. We present the results of 20 peer-reviewed articles reporting empirical studies of applying design thinking methods in an educational context with young learners. The results show that previous research has identified three themes of reasons to apply design thinking in early childhood education and care: enhancing multidisciplinary teaching, teaching design thinking as a method and supporting children’s developmental domains, and participatory learning. The ways to apply design thinking with young learners also coalesced into three themes: children acting as designers by solving real-life problems, open-ended science problems, and challenges in imaginary play. In conclusion, we consider these findings from the perspective of teaching craft, design, and technology education for young learners.',

    title: 'Alopecia in Female Athletes Using Androgenic and Anabolic Steroids: Pathophysiology and Management.',
    abstract: 'Performance-enhancing substances (PES) are used by many athletes worldwide to improve performance and enhance appearance. Although PES are more commonly used by men, use is increasing among women, leading to growing physical and psychosocial concerns. Illegal PES include androgenic and anabolic steroids (AAS), which represent a diverse class of synthetic derivatives of testosterone. PES use has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, neurologic, infectious, hepatic, renal, and musculoskeletal disorders. Additionally, hormonal alterations secondary to PES use can induce or accelerate female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Despite the widespread prevalence of FPHL, research has disproportionately focused on male pattern hair loss (MPHL) and male athletes utilizing PES. This review article explores the pathophysiology of testosterone, gender-based AAS dosing implications, incidence of FPHL, physical and psychosocial impacts of alopecia, and management strategies. Though research regarding the impact of androgen-based PES on hair health exists, few studies address these issues in the context of female athletes. Importantly, clinicians must be equipped to provide female athletes with education regarding potential risks of AAS and to appropriately manage FPHL in this patient population. Furthermore, timely diagnosis and treatment of FPHL, alongside AAS cessation, are crucial to preventing further hair loss and optimizing the safety and efficacy of alopecia treatments. Given the compounded psychosocial concerns among female athletes worldwide on PES-including hair loss, body image insecurities, and even eating disorders-ongoing research in this area is critical.',

    title: "Being the nurse's eyes and ears: a mixed methods study of assistant nurses' perceptions of their role regarding drug-related problems in nursing homes.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Insufficient knowledge among assistant nurses (ANs) in nursing homes (NHs) on medicines and drug-related problems (DRPs) in older people causes difficulties in acknowledging the side effects of medications, which can be harmful to the individual and endangers patient safety. The aim of this study was to explore the ANs' thoughts on their professional role in preventing DRPs in NH residents, their self-perceived knowledge about medicines, DRPs and physiological conditions in older people, and their wishes concerning further medical education.\n" +
      'METHODS: This mixed methods study took place in Sweden, in 2022. First, a survey was conducted at nine NHs, with a total of 112 respondents. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and groups were compared using t-tests. Thereafter, semi-structured interviews were performed at four NHs and included 20 participants. A qualitative content analysis was performed.\n' +
      `RESULTS: In the survey, a generally good self-perceived knowledge of medicines was reported. In the interviews, three main categories were identified: "Professional role of the AN", "Perspectives on pharmacotherapy in older people" and "Approaches to knowledge". Their professional role entailed different aspects, including the central assignment of observing the residents whilst having delimited responsibilities and knowledge. Regarding pharmacotherapy, the self-perceived knowledge was generally good, but more specific questions regarding DRPs proved a lack of widespread competence. An approach to obtain more knowledge was found in the possibility for ANs to attend ward rounds. A latent theme emerged in the professional role of the AN in preventing DRPs by being the nurse's eyes and ears for patient safety.\n` +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The AN's perceived their professional role in preventing DRPs in NHs as being the nurse's eyes and ears for patient safety. Generally, the ANs' self-perceived knowledge of medicines was good, although self-perceived knowledge regarding DRPs, and the physiology of older people, was sparser. A positive attitude towards attending ward rounds to contribute firsthand information on the residents, as well as the opportunity to receive knowledge, existed among the respondents. We propose a working model within the framework of doctor's ward rounds at NHs to increase the knowledge of ANs and utilise their knowledge of patients' well-being for safe medication follow-up.",

    title: "Effect of educational training about CAM-ICU on nurses' knowledge, confidence, and practice to detect delirium among critically ill patients in intensive care unit.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a serious complication associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline. Early detection through standardized assessment tools is critical to improving patient outcomes. This study evaluated the effect of an educational training program on ICU nurses' self-reported knowledge, perceived self-confidence, and comfort levels in using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), as well as their observed performance in delirium assessment and documentation.\n" +
      'METHODS: A quasi-experimental single-group pretest-posttest design was conducted with 50 ICU nurses in an Egyptian ICU. Participants received a four-week educational program on delirium and CAM-ICU use. Knowledge, confidence, and comfort levels were measured before and after training using validated questionnaires. Post-training performance was assessed using an observational checklist evaluating assessment accuracy, documentation completeness, and consistency. Paired t-test was used for data analysis.\n' +
      "RESULTS: ICU nurses' knowledge and confidence in using the CAM-ICU significantly improved after training (p < .001). Post-training, assessment accuracy (95.5%) and documentation completeness (91.3%) were high, while practice consistency (79%) met the satisfactory threshold (≥ 75%), indicating satisfactory performance in delirium assessment and documentation using CAM-ICU.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The educational training significantly improved ICU nurses' knowledge, perceived self-confidence, comfort levels, and practical skills in delirium assessment using the CAM-ICU, leading to more accurate and consistent screening practices. Structured, interactive training should be integrated into ICU education to promote standardized delirium assessment in ICU settings.\n" +
      'IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Integrating structured delirium education into ICU training can promote adherence to best practices, ensuring timely detection and intervention. Future research should examine long-term skill retention and its effect on patient outcomes.\n' +

    title: "Professional educators' experiences teaching internationally educated nurses attending bridging programs: a qualitative interview study.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: To aid in the recertification and integration process of internationally educated nurses (IENs), many countries have organized bridging programs to provide support and education and align their knowledge and competence with local requirements. The importance and relevance of these programs for IENs are highlighted in related research. However, the experiences of university teachers, supervisors in clinical placement, and administrators organizing these programs are scarcely explored. The aim of this article is to explore the experiences of professional educators engaged in bridging programs at two universities in Sweden.\n' +
      'METHODS: A descriptive qualitative approach was employed. The data were collected between December 2021 and March 2023 through semi-structured interviews with 15 educators involved in bridging programs at two universities in Sweden. The participants included university teachers, administrators, and supervisors in clinical placement. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis.\n' +
      'FINDINGS: The thematic analysis identified two main themes: (1) teaching a heterogeneous group of students and (2) organizational constraints of bridging programs. In relation to the first main theme, three subthemes were identified: educational and professional heterogeneity of IENs, varying language competencies of IENs and finding new approaches to teaching IENs. For the second main theme, three sub-themes were identified: compressed time in bridging programs, lack of resources for a time-consuming education and bridging programs as competition for resources.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the understanding of the challenges associated with the recertification process of IENs through bridging programs from the perspective of educators. The findings highlight that educating a heterogeneous group of students, such as internationally educated nurses with differences in professional experience, knowledge and local language competencies, is time-consuming. Educators need to learn about the level of knowledge of the student group and individual learning needs and adapt the instructions accordingly, which is constrained by the organization of the programs. The findings also indicate that educators can find ways to mitigate these challenges and adapt their instructions to meet the needs of students. Therefore, it is important to allocate time and resources to running bridging programs and to support the cooperation and exchange of information between universities and clinics. We also suggest the need to increase the competency level of educators on how to support learning through a second language and enhancing collaboration with language instructors to ensure high-quality education for IENs.',

      'METHODS: In this single-centre, anesthesiology resident-led quality improvement initiative in British Columbia, Canada, we started a soft plastics recycling collection program in a single operating room (OR) and expanded it to 12 ORs through a series of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The outcome measure was the daily weight of soft plastics recycled. We tracked the number of mistakes as a balancing measure. We collected data eight months after the conclusion of the project to assess sustained changes. We visualized data with Shewhart control charts.\n' +
      'RESULTS: One OR resulted in a mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 194 (157) g of soft plastics collected daily. Once we expanded to all ORs, a mean (SD) of 1,524 (708) g of waste was collected daily. A mean (SD) of 1,284 (613) g was recycled daily during the eight-month follow-up. There was a median [interquartile range (IQR)] of 0 [0-2] mistakes per day with only one OR, which increased to a median [IQR] of 2 [1-4] mistakes per day upon expansion, and remained low at eight months, with a median [IQR] of 1 [0-3] mistake per day. E-mail reminders and signage improved the error rate.\n' +

    title: 'Diabetogenic elevated childhood total fat in South Asian and Black African/Caribbean people relates to adverse early life growth and low socioeconomic position compared with White people in the UK.',
    abstract: 'AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Excess type 2 diabetes mellitus in minority ethnic groups remains unexplained, although greater fat mass makes a strong contribution. We hypothesised that height and weight through infancy in South Asian and Black African/Caribbean subgroups is more adverse than in White populations. These, allied to poor socioeconomic position, determine greater fat mass at age 7 years.\n' +
      'METHODS: We report a secondary analysis from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, including 12,280 births of White ethnicity, and 358 of Indian, 650 of Pakistani, 268 of Bangladeshi, 163 of Black Caribbean and 277 of Black African ethnicity between 2000 and 2002. Birthweight was reported, and heights and weights were measured at ages 3, 5, 7, 11, 14 and 17 years. Bioimpedance captured fat mass, indexed to height, at ages 7, 11, 14 and 17 years. Standardised differences in anthropometry, using the White group as the comparator, were calculated. We explored the effect of early growth on ethnic differences in fat-mass index at age 7 years. Confounders included maternal anthropometry, smoking, infant breastfeeding, education, parental income and area-level socioeconomic deprivation.\n' +
      'RESULTS: All minority ethnic subgroups had lower birthweight and accelerated infant height and weight growth compared with White children. By age 3 years, mean height was greater in all minority ethnic groups than in White children. This height advantage was progressively lost, first in Bangladeshi children. By age 17 years in boys/girls, Indians were 1.77/2.48 cm, Pakistanis 2.24/3.44 cm, Bangladeshis 4.83/5.95 cm and Black Caribbeans 1.64/0.49 cm shorter than White children. Heights were equivalent in Black African children. By age 17 years, all South Asian children were lighter, and Black African/Caribbean children heavier, than White children. The anthropometric gradient by ethnicity in children mirrored that in mothers. Girls from minority ethnic groups were more likely to be menstruating by age 11 years than White girls (range 12-27% vs 9%). At age 7 years, standardised fat-mass index (kg/m) in boys/girls was 0.17/0.01 SDs greater in Indian, 0.21/0.04 in Pakistani, 0.18/0.16 in Bangladeshi, 0.48/0.35 in Black Caribbean and 0.37/0.75 in Black African children than in White children. These differences persisted to age 17 years. Weight gain to age 3 years, and in Black Africans/Caribbeans, adverse individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic position, contributed to ethnic differences in fat mass.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Minority ethnic groups in the UK have poorer childhood growth than White children, achieving shorter height, greater fat mass and earlier female puberty. Mirroring of maternal and offspring ethnic subgroup gradients in height and weight indicates intergenerational transmission.

    title: 'Clinical and patient-reported outcomes of distal femur fracture fixation in adults aged 18-50 years.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: To describe nonunion and fracture-related infection (FRI) rates and patient-reported outcomes following operative treatment for distal femur fractures in young patients.\n' +
      'METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients (aged 18-50) who were operatively treated for a distal femur fracture between 2006 and 2023 with ≥ 3-month clinical follow-up at two Level 1 Trauma Centers. Outcomes included reoperation for nonunion and FRI; and PROMIS physical function (PF), depression, and anxiety (reference population mean: 50). Multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors associated with PROMIS-PF.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Eighty-six patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 34 years, 71% were male, 42% had an open fracture, and for 38 patients PROMIS scores were collected at an average of 9.8 years after treatment. Eleven patients (13%) required reoperation for nonunion and 3 (3.5%) for FRI. Median PROMIS-PF was 47.0 (IQR: 41.2-52.4), depression 45.8 (IQR: 38.9-53.6), and anxiety 46.7 (IQR: 39.5-60.5). PROMIS-PF was lower than the reference population score (p < 0.05). Increased age (1-year; ß: - 0.39; 95%CI: - 0.62 to - 0.17; p < 0.001) and BMI (1-unit; ß: - 0.59; 95%CI: - 0.98 to - 0.20; p = 0.004) at time of injury were associated with worse PROMIS-PF scores and longer follow-up (1-year; ß: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.3; p = 0.004) with better scores.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: One in 8 young patients with a distal femur fracture underwent reoperation for nonunion and one in 33 for FRI. Physical function scores were marginally lower than the reference population, whereas depression and anxiety scores were similar. The finding that physical function scores were more influenced by baseline patient factors than injury characteristics is important for prognostication and patient education. These results should be interpreted in the context of the small sample size, and future research with larger cohorts is needed to confirm these findings and better understand long-term functional outcomes in young patients following treatment of distal femur fractures.',

    title: 'Assessment of Awareness, Attitude, and Opinion of Indian Farmers on Microplastic Pollution in Agroecosystems.',
    abstract: "The increasing use of plastics in agriculture is contributing to persistent microplastic or nanoplastic pollution, which contaminates soil and affects agroecosystems. Understanding farmers' knowledge and practices is crucial for mitigating this issue. This study examines the awareness, attitudes, and opinions of Indian farmers regarding microplastic pollution. A survey of 310 crop farmers from 19 regions of India was conducted from September 2023 to March 2024 using a random sampling method to assess their knowledge, practices, attitudes, and opinions. The findings highlight limited awareness about microplastics, with only 33.5% of respondents having prior knowledge, and 66.5% were unaware of microplastic pollution. Random forest analysis identified education as the most significant predictor of farmers' awareness and attitudes toward microplastic pollution, followed by age and gender. Additionally, 74.8% of farmers expressed significant concern about the impact of plastic pollution on agriculture and human health, and 90% of respondents expressed strong interest in learning how to minimize microplastic pollution. The study recommends policies that holistically address plastic pollution in agroecosystems, like integrating plastic waste management into the existing national policies, biodegradable alternatives, stakeholder engagement, market incentives, state-specific training programs, research, and outreach activities. These findings have key implications for enhancing environmental sustainability and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.",
