    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    summary: "In today's era of knowledge innovation, STEM workers are the source of motivation for economic progress in many economies, and model-based STEM technical and vocational education is more conducive to establishing students’ entrepreneurial scientific thinking abilities. As a result, this study focuses on 169 students’ assessments and interviews on their entrepreneurial scientific thinking skills following the educational technology experience learning activity. The research results show the following four points: (1) The developed entrepreneurial scientific thinking ability questionnaire has high reliability; (2) This questionnaire is feasible in model-based STEM education; (3) After STEM experiential learning of the entrepreneurial scientific thinking, 47% of students showed high-efficiency entrepreneurial scientific thinking ability; (4) Through thematic interviews, we can better understand the difficulties students face during the experience process, and can use learning experience and interaction to solve technical problems. In the future, STEM learning will enrich the overall ability of entrepreneurial scientific thinking to improve from action, doing and understanding.",

    title: 'Optimization of Corporate Governance from the Perspectives of Law and Economics and Blockchain',
    summary: 'Blockchain’s spontaneous consensus mechanism, characterized by technologies of decentralization, immutability, high transparency, and codification, helps address agency costs and the formalization of shareholder meetings in traditional corporate governance. With the advancement of blockchain technology, the integration of legal rules and code rules in corporate governance has become the new norm. As per the transaction cost theory of law and economics and the Coase Theorem, blockchain has promoted changes in governance rules by markedly reducing agency costs within companies. Corporate governance will exhibit partial and gradual adjustments when blockchain technology substantially diminishes these costs but falls short of achieving the optimal state of zero transaction costs. These changes not only enhance the transparency and efficiency of corporate governance but also effectively curb the misconduct of controlling shareholders and protect the rights of minority shareholders.',

    summary: 'Although Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) presents vast opportunities and potential within the educational domain, the optimal integration of educational theory with GAI to enhance academic performance and problem-solving skills remains an area that requires further exploration. Therefore, this study aims to develop an integrating GAI with self-explanations scaffolding platform to enhance students’ learning performance and problem-solving skills through completing scaffolding tasks. Furthermore, this study evaluates students’ perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the system based on the Technology Acceptance Model. The findings indicate that students in the experimental group demonstrated a significant improvement in learning performance and problem-solving skills after utilizing the platform proposed by this study. Additionally, the experimental group exhibited positive technology acceptance toward the platform. Finally, results from the semi-structured interviews suggest that learning programming through the self-explanations scaffolding platform can mitigate learning setbacks, provide cognitive guidance, strengthen conceptual connections, facilitate knowledge construction, and enhance application skills.',

Based on the 6E+R learning model, an AI-supported summative reflection tool was implemented in a collaborative problem-solving (CPS) activity to examine its effects on students’ learning motivation, teamwork competency, and reflective content. A total of 28 high school students participated in a one-day Micro:bit autonomous vehicle workshop and were randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group.

Topic modeling using BERTopic revealed that the experimental group's reflections focused more on strategy adjustment, logical reasoning, and conceptual understanding, whereas the control group's reflections were more descriptive and operational. These findings suggest that AI-supported structured feedback can enhance the quality of student reflections, increase learning engagement, and improve collaborative interactions. This study demonstrates the practical value and effectiveness of AI-assisted reflection within the 6E+R instructional model, offering new directions for reflective design in STEM collaborative learning and expanding the potential of generative AI in educational settings.",

    title: 'Non-Immersive Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) with XR Elements in Nursing Education: Learning Interaction and Clinical Competence',
    summary: 'The way nursing students acquire clinical competence and patient safety awareness has changed as a result of the adoption of virtual learning environments (VLEs) in healthcare education. Non-immersive VLEs that display virtual scenarios offer secure learning experiences. Easily accessible and reasonably priced non-immersive VLEs can safely enhance learning clinical procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no earlier research on non-immersive VLEs with extended reality (XR) elements in nursing education, and this research fills that gap. This study investigates nursing students’ expectations and experiences of using non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to learn interaction and clinical competence, such as infusion pump operations. It also explores the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the use of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements in this context. Fifteen first-year nursing students engaged in two non-immersive learning scenarios. The learning process was structured using a seven-phase simulation pedagogy. The data were collected using pre- and post-questionnaires; group discussions; and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings highlight the potential of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to enhance engagement, confidence, and competence acquisition in nursing students while complementing traditional hands-on training. The study highlights the importance of blended learning strategies that integrate technical and scenario-based approaches, as well as simulation pedagogy, to optimize knowledge retention and clinical competency development. As digital technologies continue to shape healthcare education, non-immersive VLEs with XR elements are valuable in bridging the gap between theory and practice, ultimately contributing to patient safety and improved healthcare outcomes.',

    title: 'Conversion Process in the Production and Distribution of Digital Resources in Higher Education',
    summary: 'Academics worldwide are the main creators of digital resources for various purposes in educational settings. These digital resources can be created, stored, shared, and accessed across multiple digital platforms. Generally, these resources fall into categories such as online resources, electronic resources, research publications, open educational resources, and open-source materials, among others. While all academics are encouraged to contribute to the production and distribution of these digital resources, challenges remain. It is unclear whether all academics are able or willing to contribute. Currently, there is a lack of a clear conversion process framework to guide academics to convince others to adopt digital resources. This study aims to explore how those who do contribute can persuade others to participate or take the initiative. To address this issue, the study proposed the conversion process as its conceptual framework. An interpretivist approach was adopted, employing qualitative methods as the primary research strategy, which included 54 semi-structured interviews conducted at the University of South Africa. The findings indicate that both academics and institutional social capital play crucial roles in the conversion process, as they influence others to utilize digital resources. Additionally, this study contributes by proposing a conceptual framework for the conversion process and recommends further testing of this framework within the technology development contexts.',

    title: 'A Virtual Reality-Based Co-creation Approach to Developing Narrative Competence and Empathy in EFL Nursing Education',
    summary: 'This study investigates the use of virtual reality (VR) as a pedagogical tool to foster English narrative competence and empathy among nursing students in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. Through a 16-week course-integrated intervention, 98 third-year nursing students in a five-year associate degree program at a junior nursing college participated in a co-creation project using CoSpaces Edu to collaboratively design immersive, first-person 3D narratives based on an end-of-life care scenario. The project aimed to develop students’ linguistic skills while promoting humanistic understanding through perspective-taking. Employing a mixed-methods design, the study incorporated pre- and post-intervention vocabulary tests, oral narrative evaluations, student reflections, and interviews. Results demonstrated significant gains in English vocabulary and narrative expression, increased oral confidence, and evidence of enhanced empathy as students adopted diverse character roles in their digital stories. The findings underscore the pedagogical affordances of VR-based co-creation in EFL instruction for healthcare students, revealing how immersive storytelling can bridge language learning with humanistic nursing education. Implications for XR-enhanced language education and interdisciplinary curriculum design are discussed.',

    title: 'Using Social Network Analysis to Analyze Eye-Tracking Behavior Data in Education Science',
    summary: 'This study aims to systematically evaluate the use of social network analysis (SNA) metrics to measure eye-tracking behavior to assess and predict student learning performance. We integrated 11 network metrics from published research and tested them on six eye-tracking datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that no consistent predictor variable can effectively predict student performance across different datasets. The number of nodes, edges, reciprocity, and entropy measures contribute differently to predicting students’ performance. This work deepens our understanding of how different SNA metrics relate to eye-tracking data and advances the methodological framework to predict learning outcomes.',

    title: 'Sensory impairment and dementia risk among older adults in rural South Africa.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: South Africa faces growing dementia challenges, worsened by limited medical resources and low education. Modifiable risk factors like hearing and vision impairments remain understudied despite their high prevalence.\n' +
      'METHODS: We analyzed data from 567 participants in a rural South African cohort to examine the associations between vision and hearing impairment, and dementia outcomes. Multinomial logistic regression assessed associations between sensory impairments (distance vision, near vision, hearing) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Linear regression examined sensory impairment and predicted dementia probability score 2 years later.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Half of the participants were over 70, with no formal education. Sensory impairments were common, especially in dementia cases. Distance vision impairment was linked to both MCI and dementia, while near vision and hearing impairments were associated with dementia. Hearing impairment also predicted higher dementia probability after 2 years.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: Addressing sensory impairments is key to dementia prevention in rural South Africa.\n' +
      'HIGHLIGHTS: Among rural older South Africans, 65% had near vision impairment and 47% had hearing impairment. Distance or near vision and hearing impairments are linked to an increased risk of dementia. Distance vision impairment is also associated with a higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Dementia risk was seven times higher with distance vision, near vision and hearing impairment. Hearing impairment increased the probability of dementia 2 years later in initially non-demented individuals.',

    title: 'Comprehensive Comparative Analysis of the Efficiency of Two Clearing Agents in Natural Transparent Teeth Preparation for Dental Education.',
    abstract: 'AIM: To assess the effectiveness of the benzyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol (BABB) solution in transparent teeth preparation compared to methyl salicylate using comprehensive digital and radiographic quantitative values analysis.\n' +
      "METHODOLOGY: Freshly extracted 32 single-rooted teeth were immersed in 10% formalin for 24 h. They were then processed following a standard demineralization and dehydration protocol. The teeth were then divided into two groups: the first group, consisting of 12 teeth, was immersed in the BABB solution for 24 h; the second group of 20 teeth underwent the traditional protocol, which involved soaking the teeth in 99% methyl salicylate for the same duration. The optical properties of the processed teeth's translucency were evaluated by transluminant light imaging using a collimated light source and digital camera. Radiographic images of each tooth included in the study, along with a control group consisting of a freshly extracted natural tooth, were acquired under standardised computer settings, exposure conditions and X-ray tube positioning. The segmentation of the radiographic images into superpixels and the selection of areas of interest were conducted in the same manner as with visible light images. Image processing algorithms within the MatLab computational environment were utilised to assess the colour and intensity of the translucent light at the apical region of the root for each tooth.\n" +
      'RESULTS: The optical properties of selected anatomical locations were consistent across both groups of teeth when evaluating hue, saturation and value of pixels. The X-ray absorption in the translucent teeth was significantly lower than that in the non-translucent teeth, with notable differences observed between the groups; specifically, teeth affected by BABB material exhibited greater permeability to X-rays than those affected by methyl salicylate.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The BABB solution demonstrates comparable efficacy to methyl salicylate regarding the optical properties of translucent teeth. When examining X-ray absorption, teeth treated with the BABB solution exhibited greater permeability to X-ray absorption than those treated with methyl salicylate.',

    title: 'Knowledge, acceptance, uptake barriers and missed opportunities of human papillomavirus vaccine among female adolescents in Benin City, Nigeria: A mixed method study.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has shown efficacy against cervical cancer and HPV-related malignancies. The vaccine was recently introduced in Nigeria as a routine immunization, free for young girls aged 9 to 14 years. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, acceptance, uptake barriers and missed opportunities of HPV immunization among adolescents in Benin City, Nigeria.\n' +
      'METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional study using mixed methods for data collection was carried out in four secondary schools in Benin City, Nigeria, over a 3-month period, following ethical approval. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0, and qualitative data were analyzed using themes. P-values were set at less than 0.05.\n' +
      'RESULTS: There were 801 students with a mean age group of 14.3 ± 1.85. Only 56.5% had heard of the HPV vaccine; 15.5% had good knowledge of HPV, 23.4% received the vaccine, while 25.8% were willing to receive the vaccine when available. The reasons for refusal were fear of side effects (56.3%), fear of needles (18.2%), and lack of adequate information (11.3%). The missed opportunity was 71.9%. Fathers with primary level education and an odds ratio of 0.181 (95% confidence interval: 0.034-0.947, P = 0.043) and pupils of schools located in rural settings with an odds ratio of 0.369 (95% confidence interval: 0.205-0.665, P < 0.001) were less likely to accept the HPV vaccine. The teachers agreed that HPV vaccination was a good idea, while the parents shared divergent views.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: In this study, the knowledge and acceptance of HPV vaccine were found to be low, and there was a significant proportion of missed opportunities. An improved public awareness campaign is advocated.',

    title: `"The Technology We've Been Forced to Use": Impact of Online Service Delivery for Kinship Families During the COVID-19 Pandemic.`,
    abstract: "PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly changed the service landscape for both professionals and families. Kinship families, who often navigate multiple systems concurrently with higher service needs, were among the most vulnerable. This study explores kinship caregivers' and child welfare professionals' perceptions of changes in service delivery during the pandemic, specifically the sudden shift to virtual platforms.\n" +
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS: To understand participants' experiences, focus groups with protocols shaped by initial Delphi Rounds were implemented with 25 kinship caregivers and 34 child welfare professionals from a national sample.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Caregiver and professionals shared themes related to how COVID-19 precautions impacted service delivery; kinship families' access to, knowledge, and use of technology; and benefits and challenges for implementing virtual support.\n" +
      'DISCUSSION: Based on findings shared by participants, a model illustrating influencing factors for online service delivery was created highlighting technological capital, client factors, provider factors, and service type as key components. Implications of implementing online supports in practice are discussed, including technology access, training in social work education, and future research areas.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: Despite the many adversities the COVID-19 pandemic presented for professionals and kinship families, this unprecedented time also paved the way for us think differently about service accessibility and the benefits and challenges of online supports, especially in a world that is quickly moving toward automation. Considering both families' and professionals' perspectives is key to integrating virtual supports into the current service delivery landscape in equitable and effective ways.",

    title: 'A qualitative exploration of STI partner notification services delivery models among key stakeholders in rural southwestern Uganda.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Comprehensive STI care requires not only patient treatment but STI partner notification (PN) and evaluation to prevent ongoing STI transmission and reinfection. In rural, southwestern Uganda, we explored healthcare practitioners' views on three STI PN models that focused on task-shifting to non-physician practitioners to inform the development of a novel STI PN services delivery system.\n" +
      "METHODS: From September to November 2023, we conducted individual in-depth interviews with 32 participants from 4 categories (8 participants from each category): patients with a self-reported history of having an STI in Uganda, healthcare workers (physicians, nurses, and community health workers), pharmacists, and healthcare administrators (Ministry of Health officials and regional referral hospital administrators). Interviews explored participants' views on a nursing-based, pharmacy-based, and community-based STI PN models as well as healthcare system tools and needs to facilitate PN. We used inductive and deductive approaches to generate a codebook guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research in a thematic analysis.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Ten female and twenty-two male participants participated in individual in-depth interviews. The median age of the patient and healthcare practitioner participants was 32 and 34 years, respectively. We found that (1) the nursing model was overall supported as nurses (though with one participant noting dissatisfaction with nurses), (2) pharmacies are well-positioned to engage in STI PN as they are early points of contact for patients, incentivized monetarily by PN and patient-delivered partner medication, and have the potential to physically restructure to create private spaces and increase counseling training, (3) the community-based model should center on village health teams and focus on advocacy and education.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Given the high STI incidence globally and in sub-Saharan Africa, exploring innovative STI care models that resonate with patients and healthcare practitioners will be important. Future work includes a Delphi method to refine these models for testing.',

    title: 'Exploring professional vision of vet students and tutors: noticing, evaluating and reasoning about practice.',
    abstract: "In dual vocational education and training (VET) programs, students learn across school and work contexts. Educators in both these contexts reside in different socio-cultural practices and can have different or even contradicting views on practice, influencing their guidance. In this study, we used the concept of professional vision to explore differing views on practice between participants with various educational roles, namely students, school teachers and workplace supervisors. In total, 11 students, 11 school teachers and seven workplace supervisors were asked to view the same set of five videos showing apprentices in the domain of underground infrastructure performing domain-specific tasks. Participants were asked to explain what they noticed in the videos and evaluate the apprentices' performance. The data analysis consisted of a mixed-method approach. We quantitatively compared how educational roles viewed and evaluated task performance, followed by a qualitative ventriloquial analysis of their reasoning. Our findings highlight the diversity in professional vision among participants. Participants focused on different elements of practice, evaluated the same elements differently and showed variations in their reasoning. However, this could only be partly explained by their educational role. These findings suggest a need to prepare VET students for the different views of practice they will encounter during their careers, ultimately forming their well-founded professional vision.",

    title: 'The Need to Enhance the Use of Teleconsultation: A Qualitative Study Among Health Providers to Reduce the Burden of Low Birth Weight.',
    abstract: ' Low birth weight remains a health concern in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Effective management of low birth weight cases is crucial, yet community-based health programs face challenges in addressing this issue.  This study is aimed at exploring the needs, experience, and perspectives of healthcare providers regarding low birth weight prevention programs.  This was a qualitative descriptive study. Data were collected from June to December 2023 in Kulon Progo District, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Data were collected through a focus group discussion with nine midwives. Triangulation was conducted with 12 breastfeeding mothers, one nutritionist, and one head of the primary health center through in-depth interviews. Each discussion and interview were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to thematic analysis to identify key themes.  Three themes were discovered in this study: programmatic initiatives of healthcare providers; poor knowledge, attitude, and practice with limited resources and access; enhancing the use of teleconsultations. Programmatic initiatives from primary healthcare centers have focused on preventing low birth weight through targeted outreach, education, and prenatal care for at-risk mothers. However, the persistent challenge of insufficient human resources for health has hindered the effectiveness and reach of these efforts. To enhance LBW prevention strategies, the needs of digital technology by integrating digital tools and electronic health records are imperative.  Effectively managing low birth weight requires utilization of technology to strengthen healthcare interventions. Digital solutions enhance communication, broaden service reach, and enable timely support, especially in underserved areas. Incorporating these tools into health programs improves the delivery and accessibility of care, presenting a valuable approach to advancing maternal and child health outcomes.',

    title: 'Factors influencing nutritional literacy among rural older adults: a cross-sectional survey based on the theory of planned behavior.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors influencing nutritional literacy among rural elderly individuals in northern Sichuan based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB).\n' +
      'METHODS: A convenience sampling method was employed to recruit 311 elderly participants (aged ≥60 years) from Sanlin Village (Cangxi County, Guangyuan City), Puji Village (Yilong County, Nanchong City), and Luhua Village (Bazhou District, Bazhong City). The survey instruments included general demographic questionnaires, the nutrition attitude scale (NAS), the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS), the instrumental activities of daily living scale (IADLS), the general self-efficacy scale (GSES), and the nutrition literacy questionnaire for the Chinese elderly (NLQ-E). Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 23.0.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that education level positively predicted nutritional literacy (β = 0.126,  = 2.659,  < 0.01), while denture use due to tooth damage negatively predicted nutritional literacy (β = -0.077,  = -2.375,  < 0.05). Nutrition attitude (β = 0.312,  = 6.662,  < 0.001) and perceived social support (β = 0.243,  = 4.283,  < 0.001) were positive predictors, whereas daily living ability exhibited a negative predictive effect (β = -0.251,  = -4.445,  < 0.001). Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated that nutrition attitude had a direct effect of 0.333 and an indirect effect of 0.050 on nutritional literacy. Daily living ability showed a direct effect of -0.481 and an indirect effect of -0.101. Self-efficacy partially mediated the relationships between nutrition attitude and nutritional literacy, as well as between daily living ability and nutritional literacy.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Elderly individuals in northern Sichuan with more positive nutrition attitudes, higher perceived social support, and stronger daily living abilities demonstrated higher nutritional literacy. Self-efficacy partially mediated the influence of nutrition attitude and daily living ability on nutritional literacy.',

    title: "A Novel Microlearning Asynchronous Curriculum to Improve Internal Medicine Trainees' Confidence and Skill in Interpreting ECGs.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Skills in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation are critical in clinical decision making but remain poor among Internal Medicine residents. There remains no standardized method for teaching ECG interpretation.\n' +
      'METHODS: This study aimed to leverage the benefits of microlearning by assessing an asynchronous microlearning ECG curriculum for Internal Medicine residents at a single academic residency program between September 2023 and June 2024. The ECG curriculum was comprised of 30 mandatory weekly ECGs which included a clinical vignette, a 12-lead ECG, and a single multiple-choice or free response question posted on Microsoft Teams. Residents were required to submit interpretations within 1 week, after which the answer, a short description of ECG findings, and clinical pearls were posted. Data collection included pre-post surveys with a 1- to 5-Likert scale measuring self-reported confidence and a test containing 15 unique ECGs.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of 151 total categorical and preliminary Internal Medicine residents, 38 (25.2%) completed pre-post surveys and were analyzed as matched pairs. Residents demonstrated increases in Likert ratings of confidence (mean post-pre score difference 0.44 of 5,  = <.01), overall performance (mean post-pre raw score difference 0.97 of 15,  = <.01), and performance in identifying normal variants (mean post-pre score subset difference 14.21%,  = .017). Residents had no significant change in performance in identifying tachyarrhythmias (mean post-pre score subset difference 5.9%,  = .24), ST-segment changes (0.88%,  = 0.89), or conduction disease (-0.65%,  = .92).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this curriculum was effective in improving resident confidence in and knowledge of ECG interpretation, with a particular strength in identifying normal/normal variants. Next steps include targeting specific ECG pathologies in which residents show particular knowledge gaps and creation of a 3-year longitudinal curriculum to reinforce knowledge over the course of a 3-year residency.',

    title: 'Early Detection and Intervention Practices Provided by Physical and Occupational Therapists in Saudi Arabia for Children with or at Risk for Cerebral Palsy.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Accurate cerebral Palsy (CP) diagnosis is possible before or at the age of 5 months. However, little is known about the practice of early detection guidelines in Saudi Arabia. The objective of this study was to explore the current physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) early detection practices for children (0-3 years) with or at risk for CP and knowledge and application of evidence-based practices (EBP) for these children.\n' +
      'PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a purpose-developed electronic survey was distributed to physical and occupational therapists who work with young children with or at risk of CP. Descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations were employed to analyse the data.\n' +
      "RESULTS: A total of 76 participants completed the survey questions and were included in the analysis. Less than half of the patients (46%) received a diagnosis of being at risk for CP between 0 and 5 months of age. Only 16% of the participants are certified in using the Prechtl Qualitative Assessment. Seventy-eight percent of the participants provide parents with prognostic information regarding their children's diagnosis. Sixty-six percent of the providers always used goal-oriented therapy, 30% always used Neurodevelopmental Treatment, 22% always used passive intervention, and 84% always used caregiver education in their treatment. Application of constraint-induced movement therapy was significantly correlated with a number of demographic variables.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: This study showed that the majority of therapists consider EBP in evaluating and treating young children with CP. However, more attention should be directed toward training therapists to utilize sensitive tools to detect CP early, enabling them to incorporate EBP in their management plan. Although therapists follow some of the recommended interventions, many therapists still use ineffective treatments with children with CP. A national guideline is required to unify practice and illustrate the role of PT and OT in the management of CP.',
