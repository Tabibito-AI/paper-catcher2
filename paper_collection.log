    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +
      'national income model, government-purchases multiplier and tax multiplier.',

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +
      'propensity for educational attainment have been constructed. It is by now well\n' +
      'established that this PGS predicts wages, income, and occupational prestige and\n' +
      'occupational mobility across generations. It is unknown whether a PGS for\n' +
      'educational attainment can predict upward income and occupational mobility even\n' +
      'within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin\n' +
      'Longitudinal Study (WLS), I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment\n' +
      'predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when\n' +
      'respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about\n' +
      '53 years of age), conditional on 1974 values of these variables and a range of\n' +
      'covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status,\n' +
      'is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is\n' +
      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +
      'our understanding of longitudinal inequality and shed light on the sources of\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +
      'propose a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of\n' +
      'education and remains as a significant predictor of economic growth when tested\n' +
      'with both cross-section data and panel data. We argue that future research on\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +
      'Linear amplification yields S-functions as only analytic solutions.\n' +
      'Destructible physical capital controls medium-term recoveries from disaster.\n' +
      'Indestructible human capacity controls the collective long-term industrial\n' +
      'evolution. It is immune even to world wars and runs from 1800 to date parallel\n' +
      'to the unisex life expectancy in the pioneering nations. This is the first\n' +
      'quantitative information on long-term demand. The theory is self-consistent. It\n' +
      'reproduces all peaceful data from 1800 to date without adjustable parameter. It\n' +
      'has full forecasting power since the decisive parameters are constants of the\n' +

    title: 'Applications of a constrained mechanics methodology in economics',
    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +
      'physics education. The aim of the paper is: 1. to meet the demand for\n' +

      'expanding research field of econophysics even on the undergraduate level and 2.\n' +
      'to enable the students to understand deeper the principles and methods\n' +
      'routinely used in mechanics by looking at the well known methodology from the\n' +
      'different perspective of economics. Two constrained dynamic economic problems\n' +
      'are presented using the economic terminology in an intuitive way. First, the\n' +
      'Phillips model of business cycle is presented as a system of forced\n' +
      'oscillations and the general problem of two interacting economies is solved by\n' +
      'the nonholonomic dynamics approach. Second, the Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey model of\n' +

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    title: 'Reimagining Scientific Literacy: A Textbook Framework for Future-Focused Science Education',
    summary: "This study refines and advances the Framework for evaluating Scientific Literacy (SL) within science textbooks/curricula by integrating cognitive, affective, and sustainability dimensions. Through a systematic review and analysis of 22 studies, the research identifies emerging themes to restructure the Cansiz and Cansiz ( Journal of Baltic Science Education, 18 (5), 681–691, 2019 ) Framework into six comprehensive aspects: Knowledge of Science, Investigative Nature of Science, Science as a Way of Knowing, Science, Technology, Society, and Environment (STSE) Interaction, Affective Engagement with Science, and Sociopolitico-Environmental Justice and Responsibility . Key findings highlight the significance of fostering critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and interdisciplinary competencies to navigate the complexities of the Anthropocene. The Revised Framework emphasizes systems thinking, transformative action, and including marginalized perspectives, aiming to prepare learners for socio-scientific challenges. Additionally, it incorporates affective and sustainability dimensions to foster lifelong engagement with science and empower learners as change agents. The Revised Framework offers theoretical and practical contributions by bridging traditional content-focused models with transformative, justice-oriented approaches. It provides a robust tool for educators and policymakers to evaluate and enhance science textbooks/curricula, ensuring relevance and fostering globally responsive, socially impactful, critical SL. The study concludes by advocating for the Revised Framework's adaptability to diverse educational contexts and its continuous evolution to address emerging challenges.",

    summary: 'Aim This study aimed to evaluate the effect of audiovisual motivation (AVM) and oral health education (OHE) on oral health (OH) and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among children at social homes. Methods This was a double-blinded cluster-randomised clinical trial. Subjects ( n  = 225) aged 4–14 years were recruited from social homes and randomly divided into 2 groups: control group ( n  = 100) and study group ( n  = 115); each was further divided into sub-groups: 4–6, 7–12 and > 12 years. Both groups were interviewed and examined to record DMFT/dmft (baseline and 12 months), plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) (baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months). The study group had multiple AVM and OHE sessions; the control group had no intervention. Results Mean sample age was 9.1 ± 2.7 years. At 12 months, 4–6-year-olds had a significant improvement in PI for study and control groups ( P  < 0.001, P  = 0.008 respectively), and GI was significantly improved in study group ( P  < 0.001). In 7–12-year-olds, a significant improvement in the PI, GI and dmft was found in study group ( P  < 0.001 for all), with an increase in DMFT in the control group ( P  < 0.001). For > 12 years, there was a significant improvement in PI ( P  = 0.002), GI ( P  = 0.043). There was significant improvement in OHRQoL in the study group only in these domains: bleeding when brushing teeth ( P  = 0.04) and presence of bad breath in the morning ( P  < 0.001). Conclusion There was a favourable effect of AVM and OHE on OH and OHRQoL in children aged 4–14 years at social homes after 12 months.',

    title: 'Epistemic Practices Created by Discursive Interactions between Pre-service Chemistry Teachers',
    summary: 'In pre-service teacher training it is not enough to simply inform the degree candidates about teaching methods. It is necessary for the pre-service teachers to engage with selected methods in real contexts, which we comprehend as the starting point for the construction of epistemic practices. We present the constructive process of epistemic practices through the analysis of discursive interactions of a group of pre-service teachers and how the texts as material objects supported the group’s intellectual work to create the practice. Interactional, intertextual, contextual, and consequential actions influenced the construction of the epistemic practice of argumentation based on prior knowledge and text interpretation, and produced consequences for the knowledge legitimized by the group. The appropriation of contents and discussion of evidence-based knowledge elucidated the role of informative texts, which allowed pre-service teachers to propose and legitimize knowledge. This study exposes the need to more carefully consider materials in teaching and learning processes, and to examine the relations that pre-service teachers establish with the class materials provided. This unique methodological choice of analyzing epistemic practices, with a focus on the process of justifying knowledge and its relation to socio-scientific texts, contributes to new research perspectives in the field of Science Education.',

    title: 'Web-Based Computational Design Tools for Architectural Design Studio: Enhancing Pedagogical Framework',
    summary: 'As computational design becomes increasingly integrated into architectural education, balancing technical complexity with creative exploration remains a challenge. This study presents a web-based framework supporting architectural design studios through computational tools. Three applications—ANYSite, NEXUSpace, and SnapRender—assist in plot subdivision, spatial layout generation, and AI-augmented visualization. Implemented in a design studio, these tools provide structured guidance, lower learning barriers, and enhance engagement with computational methods. The study evaluates the effectiveness of these tools by analyzing student projects and feedback. Findings suggest that systematic workflow and task-oriented tool functions help students focus on design strategies while integrating computational techniques. This research contributes to architecture pedagogy by demonstrating how web-based tools can make computational design more accessible and interactive in architectural education.',

    title: 'Dual Sequence Modeling for Knowledge Tracing',
    summary: 'Knowledge tracing (KT) refers to the problem of predicting a learner’s future performance based on their past performance in education. Recently, attention-based sequence modeling methods achieve impressive predictive performance. However, existing solutions merely consider one single sequence modeling method, which might fail to capture the comprehensive state of knowledge across long sequences. In this paper, we propose D ual S equence M odeling for K nowledge T racing (DSMKT). DSMKT aims to enhance the modeling of a learner’s long-term profile by collaborating two sequence modeling methods, i.e., the masked self-attention mechanism and the gated recurrent unit. To further exploit the synergy between two sequence models, we adopt the idea of online knowledge distillation and adaptively combine two branches to form a stronger teacher model, which in turn provides predictions as extra supervision for better modeling ability. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets show that DSMKT performs excellently in predicting future learner responses.',

    summary: 'Hundreds of state and local laws and resolutions have been adopted recently to restrict how teachers teach the history of race in America. As a result, American teachers face undue scrutiny, critique, and punishment for how they approach Black history. In this volatile climate, John Brown Lives!, a human rights organization centered on the John Brown Farm State Historic Site in North Elba, New York, sought to expand outreach to teachers and students through its innovative Hands-on History project. In this paper, we introduce this initiative, which brings together educators, historians, artists, and archaeologists to develop and implement curriculum illuminating the region’s freedom history. In addition to describing its goals and the steps taken to support and listen to teachers and other stakeholders during this precarious political moment, we situate the collaboration in the history of archaeology and activism, and we offer lessons learned during its implementation.',

    title: '‘I Don’t Feel I’ve Been Exposed to Enough Physics-Related Occupations’: Career Advice and the Gendered Uptake of Physics in Australian Secondary Schools',
    summary: 'Ensuring that school graduates are adequately prepared for the transition from school to the workforce or further education is crucial for success and career satisfaction. This paper examines the influence of career advice provided in Australian schools on girls’ interest in pursuing physics courses and physics-related careers. A transformative mixed methods research approach was employed, with the theoretical framework drawing on social cognitive career theory (SCCT) from a gender perspective. Data was generated through an online survey and focus group interviews with students, as well as individual interviews with physics teachers and career advisers. The findings show that despite its potential to positively influence girls’ choices in physics, schools and students view career advice as an optional service. Consequently, the quality and quantity of career advice offered in Australian schools vary significantly from school to school and remain underutilised by most students. This particularly impacts girls’ perceptions of physics as a viable future career, leaving pervasive gendered perceptions about the subject unchallenged. This study is derived from a larger project that investigated influences on girls’ physics identity. Il est essentiel, pour la réussite et la satisfaction professionnelles, de veiller à ce que les diplômé(e)s soient suffisamment préparé(e)s pour faire la transition entre l’école et le monde du travail ou encore la poursuite de leurs études. Dans cet article, nous examinons l’influence des conseils en matière d’orientation de carrière qui sont offerts dans les écoles australiennes sur l’intérêt des filles à poursuivre des cours de physique et des carrières liées à ce domaine. Nous avons eu recours à une approche de recherche transformatrice à méthodes mixtes, dont le cadre théorique s’inspire de la théorie sociale cognitive de l’orientation scolaire et professionnelle (TSCOSP) dans une perspective genrée. Les données ont été obtenues par le biais d’un sondage en direct, d’entrevues auprès de groupes de discussion composés d’étudiants, ainsi que par des entretiens individuels avec des professeurs de physique et des conseillers en orientation professionnelle. Les résultats indiquent que les écoles et les étudiants considèrent l’orientation professionnelle comme un service facultatif, malgré la capacité de celle-ci à influencer les choix des filles en faveur de la physique. Par conséquent, la qualité et la quantité d’orientation en matière de carrières offerte dans les écoles australiennes varient considérablement d’une école à l’autre et demeurent sous-utilisées par la plupart des apprenants. Cela a des répercussions particulières sur la perception qu’adoptent les filles sur la physique en tant que domaine de carrière viable dans le futur, ce qui ne contribue pas à remettre en question les perceptions sexistes persistantes à l’égard de cette matière. Cette étude est le fruit d’un projet plus vaste qui a étudié les éléments qui influencent l’identité des filles à l’égard de la physique.',

    title: 'Has the tablet beaten textbooks? Effect of key tool features on student satisfaction',
    summary: 'As digital learning tools continue to reshape education, the debate over their effectiveness compared with traditional textbooks remains unresolved. This study provides fresh insights by examining how important feature-level factors—portability, navigability, and visual appearance—shape users’ confirmation and satisfaction with iPads and textbooks. Through a within-subject experiment conducted in a real classroom setting, 82 undergraduate students enrolled in an operations management course at a U.S. public university participated in a two-phase study over two weeks. To ensure ecological validity, students used either an iPad or a traditional textbook to solve decision science problems in their regular classroom environment before switching to the other tool in the second phase. At the end of each phase, participants completed a questionnaire assessing their perceptions of the tools and their learning experiences. This study’s findings challenge the intuitive belief that digital tools are always better than traditional ones. Furthermore, this study systematically examines the advantages and limitations of each tool regarding their detailed features, thus deepening the understanding of their role in digital learning adoption. This research offers a comparative analysis of electronic and traditional educational tools, which will provide insights for optimizing electronic education and responding to the changing landscape of learning technologies.',

    title: 'Promoting Patient Safety Through Patient Engagement at the Organisational Level: A Delphi-Based Needs Assessment Among Patient and Family Advisory Councils.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Patient and family advisory councils (PFACs) are increasingly recognised as a promising approach for improving patient safety (PS) through patient engagement (PE) at the organisational level. However, PFAC stakeholders often lack the necessary knowledge and competence to engage effectively in PS-related issues with healthcare organisations. Moreover, evidence on specific needs for knowledge and competence improvement remains limited, hindering the development of future interventions.\n' +
      "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed (a) to identify needs for PS-related competency and knowledge improvement among PFAC stakeholders and (b) to assess current and desired levels of PFAC engagement, roles and factors influencing PFACs' work.\n" +
      'DESIGN: We established an exploratory mixed-methods design with a modified, two-round Delphi approach. We first used qualitative content analysis to analyse interview data (Round 1) and then consolidated statements for a quantitative questionnaire (Round 2). Responses were analysed descriptively and for consensus (criterion: 85% agreement). Mixed-methods analysis was conducted sequentially and convergently.\n' +
      "SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: PFAC stakeholders are affiliated with German healthcare organisations, including patient representatives and professionals from healthcare organisations. MAIN VARIABLE AND OUTCOME STUDIED: (a) Needs for competency improvement on PS and communication, self-assessed knowledge and preferred training formats and (b) PFAC engagement levels, roles and factors influencing PFACs' work.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Across 6 different oncology-focused PFACs from German university hospitals, 19 stakeholders participated across both rounds. Seventeen needs for competency improvement in PS and communication were identified. After establishing consensus, 10 distinct domains of need were agreed upon (e.g., PS fundamentals, legal basis for PE and respectful communication). While PFAC engagement in PS was inconsistent, participants expressed a strong desire for further involvement. Key implementation factors included limited access to organisational processes, lack of resources and unequal conditions between research- and care-oriented councils.\n' +
      "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for targeted training and structural support to strengthen PFACs' role in PS. Competency improvement and role clarity were deemed essential for effective collaboration. Enhancing PFAC engagement in PS requires tailored educational programmes, transparent structures and institutional support. This study provides an empirical basis for interventions to improve PE in PS at the organisational level.\n" +
      "PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A patient representative was actively involved throughout the research process, contributing to the development of study materials and providing independent feedback on interview guides and questionnaires. Her input helped to shape the materials, improve their accessibility to lay audiences and ensure the inclusion of patient-relevant issues. The research team discussed her feedback in detail and revised study materials accordingly. Beyond the content presented in this manuscript, she contributed to shaping a subsequent intervention that emerged from the study's needs assessment, which was designed as a participatory approach to incorporate patient and stakeholder perspectives from the outset. In addition, she and participating stakeholders of the patient advisory councils are committed to disseminating project findings and developing recommendations to help translate research into practice from a patient perspective.\n" +

    title: 'Transplant Infectious Disease Training: Bridging the Gap.',
    abstract: 'An increasing complexity of organ transplantation, newer immunosuppressives, and an expanded donor pool requires a well-trained multidisciplinary workforce with surgeons, physicians, and infectious diseases (ID) physicians working together. In most countries, solid organ transplantation preceded the development of ID as a specialty leading to a lag in transplant infectious diseases (TID) physicians being a member of this team. This gap is further widened in low middle-income countries (LMIC) like India, where there is a dearth of laboratory facilities, which are essential for pretransplant screening and diagnosis of posttransplant infections. India though an LMIC does large volumes of organ and bone marrow transplantations. This article examines the current state of ID and TID training in India with an emphasis on the need for a structured and standardized educational pathway for future transplant professionals. Drawing on examples from existing programs and workforce data using a qualitative survey, we identify paramount challenges such as inconsistent exposure during medical and surgical training, limited access to transplant-specific education, and insufficient support for career development in transplant-related specialties. We propose a strategic framework to address these challenges with an emphasis on early exposure, interprofessional education, mentorship, and the integration of transplant content within undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. By encouraging a comprehensive national strategy, we aspire to bridge this training gap, ensuring workforce sustainability and ultimately improving patient outcomes for those awaiting transplantation.',

    title: 'Dataset for Multidimensional Poverty Index in Cali-Colombia.',
    abstract: `This article presents data collected through in-person surveys conducted in the city of Santiago de Cali, Colombia, to characterize the population registered in the city's Social Program Beneficiary Identification System (SISBÉN, by its Spanish acronym). The sample includes 1605 observations, representing individuals between 18 and 87 years of age. The survey covered various aspects of the population's general characteristics, such as gender, age, race, and education level. Additionally, information was requested about people's employment conditions (whether they are employed or seeking employment, the sector of the economy in which they work, their monthly income, whether they have health insurance, whether they contribute to a pension, in the other questions). Individuals register at the SISBÉN service points in the city and fill out the SISBÉN IV survey (which constitutes the secondary data). We randomly interviewed them at the SISBÉN points to collect additional primary data necessary to achieve the study's objectives. Using the identification, we match the SISBÉN IV survey data (secondary data) with the primary data collected at the service points, thus generating the integrated database presented in this article. The survey was designed within the framework of Interadministrative Agreement No. 4132.010.32.1.376-2024, signed between the University of Valle Foundation and the Administrative Planning Department of the District Municipality of Santiago de Cali, whose objective is to "Pool efforts and resources to administer, update, and maintain the SISBÉN database under its Methodology IV, in order to improve the quality of life of the vulnerable population by the procedures and guidelines established for this purpose by the National Planning Department" drawing on the expertise of the team of researchers in areas related to the labor market, employment quality, and multidimensional poverty. To our knowledge, no other Cali database allows the Multidimensional Poverty Index calculation. The data have also not been used in previous articles. The sampling does not fully represent the Santiago de Cali population. However, it is representative of individuals registered in SISBÉN. Potential selection bias could happen if the researcher's problem is different, for example, occupational and unemployment rates in Cali or urban locations. However, in poverty, SISBÉN classifies individuals to social benefits through a cut-off in the score. The location where individuals are registered is where the probability of poverty is high, and the data could be representative of poverty conditions in Santiago de Cali City. For example, following the DANE [1] methodology of MPI, 11.3 % of individuals registered in Cali's SISBÉN were in multidimensional poverty. These estimations were based on a sample of 44,693 households, representing a total of 112,655 individuals. The data provided in this article constitute a valuable resource for researchers, public administrators, and other stakeholders, as they allow for the analysis of employment quality and poverty among the population registered in SISBÉN.`,

    title: 'Cross-sectional evaluation of a peer educator-led empowerment initiative for improving participation in cervical precancer screening among female sex workers in Ghana.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Despite having an increased risk of HPV infection, female commercial sex workers (FCSWs) have low uptake of cervical screening. Among FCSWs in the Volta Region of Ghana referred for screening following peer education, we examined the prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) and cervical lesions and modelled factors associated with these screening outcomes.\n' +
      'PATIENTS AND METHODS: As part of the mPharma Ten Thousand Women Initiative, implemented between September and October 2022, 340 FCSWs in Ho and Aflao were recruited by peer educators. Screening involved MA-6000 testing (with full genotyping using the AmpFire HPV platform) and enhanced visual assessment (EVA) mobile colposcopy.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The FCSWs screened had a mean age of 31.9 (SD, 9.3) years. The prevalence of cervical lesions on mobile colposcopy was 9.8% (95% confidence intervals (CI), 4.9-14.7), while the prevalence of hr-HPV infection among the FCSWs was estimated at 28.0% (95% CI, 20.6-35.3). The commonest individual genotype was HPV68 (9.1%; 95% CI, 4.9-15.0), while the least common genotypes were HPV33 and HPV39 (each 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.0-3.8). FCSWs screened in Aflao maintained threefold higher odds of hr-HPV infection (aOR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.18-9.40) and having clinically significant EVA findings was associated with approximately fivefold higher odds of hr-HPV infection (aOR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.09-19.83; -value = 0.038). Condom use at the time of screening was independently associated with decreased odds of hr-HPV infection (aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49; -value = 0.002). HIV infection (aOR, 9.95; 95% CI, 1.19-83.37) and engagement in oral-genital contact (aOR, 5.56; 95% CI, 1.35-22.94) were associated with higher odds of clinically significant EVA findings.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the urgent need for comprehensive and targeted interventions to reduce the burden of hr-HPV and the potential for cervical precancer/cancer among FCSWs in Ghana. We further highlight the importance of promoting continuous condom use among FCSWs during interactions with patrons and considering HIV status in the development and implementation of cervical precancer screening programs for FCSWs.',

    title: 'Relationship between Khat chewing and upper digestive tract cancers among male patients in Hargeisa: case control study.',
    abstract: 'Khat chewing is a common cultural practice in countries bordering the Red Sea and the east coast of Africa. Despite some indications in the literature, its association with upper digestive tract (UDT) cancers is under-researched. This study investigated the relationship between khat chewing and UDT cancers among male patients in Hargeisa using a case-control design. A total of 97 respondents were included, 36 cases and 61 controls from the only two cancer clinics in Somaliland, Nageeye Cancer Clinic and Needle Hospital. The study used non-probability purposive sampling, data collection was conducted using a structured questionnaire, and data entry and cleaning were performed using SPSS version 22. Analysis was carried out using Stata MP 16. The findings revealed an association between duration, frequency and amount of khat chewing and the risk of developing UDT cancers. Specifically, individuals who chewed khat for more than 20 years had a 7.05 times higher risk ( < 0.05), those who chewed daily had a 6.89 times higher risk ( < 0.05), and heavy chewers (>600 g) had a 6.60 times higher risk ( < 0.05) of developing UDT cancers. The associations found in this study between khat chewing and UDT cancers suggest an urgent need for public health strategies, including education and policy reforms, to address and reduce the health risks posed by khat chewing in Somaliland. The study also highlighted the importance of community education and awareness programs to mitigate the adverse health effects of khat.',

    title: 'Cancer awareness through school curriculum: evidence and recommendations from a quasi-experimental study among school children in the State of Kerala, India.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Cancer is emerging as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in India and other countries worldwide. Preventable risk factors for cancer, such as the use of tobacco and alcohol, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity, are often initiated and established during adolescence. Identifying effective strategies for engaging adolescents in cancer-protective behaviours is essential. The current study investigates the potential of schools as settings and school curricula as tools for raising cancer awareness among teenagers.\n' +
      "METHODS: Consultative meetings and workshops were conducted with education, health and social services experts to develop a primer for cancer control in the school curriculum. Textbooks were scanned to determine the extent of cancer-related topics for standards five to ten. The study participants' awareness at baseline was assessed using the Cancer Awareness Measure toolkit (version 2.1). Based on these findings, a study package was developed and implemented through trained teachers. A quasi-experimental study design was used to assess the impact of the study package in improving cancer awareness.\n" +
      'RESULTS: In the post-intervention survey, the participants from the intervention schools demonstrated significant improvements in their understanding of cancer warning signs (unexplained lump or swelling ( = 0.0001), unexplained bleeding ( = 0.007), persistent cough or hoarseness ( = 0.0001), non-healing ulcers ( = 0.0001) and risk factors (consumption of fewer quantities of fruit and vegetables ( = 0.010), eating red or processed meat ( = 0.0001) and physical inactivity ( = 0.01)).\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: Implementing the cancer awareness study package through classroom teaching improved students' understanding of warning signs and risk factors for cancer. The study emphasised the role of the school as a setting, the school curriculum as a tool and teachers as promoters of cancer prevention education. However, there is no guarantee that this program will work if the learners' environment is not improved through the concurrent teaching of parents. Children learn what they live.",

    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Wilderness medicine is a growing field focused on delivering quality medical care in austere environments. Simulation-based education has proven effective in emergency and wilderness medicine, particularly in graduate medical education. We propose that introducing wilderness medicine concepts earlier in medical education as part of a high-fidelity simulation for medical students could both increase interest in wilderness medicine and have widely applicable educational benefits.\n' +
      'METHODS: We developed a novel 1-day case-based simulation curriculum to be performed in a wilderness environment and invited undergraduate medical students to participate. A 25-question survey was administered before and after the simulation to assess subjective change across various topics.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The 10 of 12 students who responded to the survey indicated that the simulation significantly increased their confidence in managing urgent medical cases and increased their interest in the wilderness medicine field. All students agreed that simulation was an effective way to learn this material.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: Implementing a wilderness medicine simulation in medical curricula appears feasible and provides a comprehensive model that can be easily adapted to other institutions.',

    title: 'Association Between Nut Consumption and Metabolic Syndrome in Korean Adults.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Although nuts have been reported to lower the risk of multiple diseases, evidence regarding their effect on metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Asian populations is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the association between nut consumption and the risk of MetS.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the seventh Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016-2018). MetS was defined according to the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Responses to a single 24-hour dietary recall from 4,365 younger adults (19-39 years), 7,498 middle-aged adults (40-64 years), and 4,378 older adults (≥65 years) were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models.\n' +
      'RESULTS: In this study, based on the culinary definition, nuts included tree nuts and peanuts. Approximately 25% of Korean adults were found to consume nuts. After adjusting for confounding variables, including age, body mass index, total energy intake, household income, alcohol consumption, smoking, aerobic exercise, and energy from carbohydrates, nut consumption was associated with a lower risk of MetS among middle-aged men (40-64 years; odds ratio [OR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.88), older men (≥65 years; OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.98), and older women (≥65 years; OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.89).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: These results suggest that consuming nuts may exert protective effects against MetS in middle-aged Korean men and older Korean adults.',

    title: "Turkish physicians' approach to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other gender and sexual minority individuals and their sexual health.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other gender and sexual minority (LGBT+) individuals often face healthcare disparities, and physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and clinical preparedness significantly impact access to competent care.\n" +
      "AIM: This study evaluated Turkish physicians' perspectives, knowledge, and clinical approaches to LGBT+ sexual health, highlighting educational and clinical gaps.\n" +
      "METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted among physicians from 10 specialties involved in LGBT+ sexual health. The survey, administered anonymously via Google Forms between June 4, 2024, and February 1, 2025, included sociodemographic questions and items assessing attitudes, clinical experience, and guideline familiarity. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-square, Fisher's exact tests, and binary logistic regression to identify predictors of physician attitudes and perceived competence.\n" +
      "OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was to assess physicians' perspectives, competency, and willingness to provide LGBT+ healthcare, including gender-affirming procedures.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Among 745 participants, 58.8% considered LGBT+ identities normal, while 22.9% classified them as psychiatric disorders. Perceiving LGBT+ identities as normal was significantly associated with being female (OR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.96-4.96,  < .001), prior experience treating LGBT+ patients (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.60-3.07,  < .001), and physician specialty. This view was most common among psychiatrists ( = .012) and child and adolescent psychiatrists ( = .015). Physicians' views were primarily shaped by education (43.2%) and socio-cultural environment (40.9%). Although 63.9% had treated LGBT+ patients, only 28.2% felt competent, and 11.5% were aware of relevant guidelines. Only 18% of surgical specialists supported gender-affirming procedures. The most commonly cited reason for reluctance was lack of surgical experience (44.8%), along with concerns related to religious beliefs, absence of a surgical team, and potential surgical complications. Ethical dilemmas were evident, as 58.3% believed LGBT+ patients face discrimination in healthcare, and 21.9% supported a physician's right to refuse care based on personal beliefs.\n" +
      "CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Enhancing physicians' education and competency in LGBT+ healthcare through structured training and standardized guidelines is crucial to improving equitable healthcare delivery.\n" +
      "STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: This study provides novel insights into physicians' attitudes and practices regarding LGBT+ healthcare in Turkey. However, self-reported data may introduce response bias, and findings may not be fully generalizable to other regions.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Significant educational and clinical gaps persist in LGBT+ healthcare. Addressing these through structured training programs, standardized protocols, and multidisciplinary collaboration is essential to ensuring competent, inclusive, and ethical medical care.',

    title: 'Recent advances and educational strategies in diagnostic imaging for temporomandibular disorders: a narrative literature review.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a group of orofacial conditions characterized by pain and dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and surrounding musculature. Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment planning. However, educational content on TMD imaging in medical and dental curricula has lagged behind recent technological advances.\n' +
      'METHODS: This review analyzes the current status of TMD imaging education based on a synthesis of literature and educational practices. It highlights discrepancies across institutional curricula and evaluates emerging strategies such as interdisciplinary learning, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted tools, and simulation-based training.\n' +
      'RESULTS: TMD imaging education is found to be inconsistent and underdeveloped globally, with significant variability in curriculum design and limited integration of modern imaging technologies. Current training programs lack standardized guidelines, resulting in knowledge gaps and increased risk of clinical misjudgment. Early findings suggest that AI and simulation tools can enhance educational outcomes.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: To bridge the gap between clinical practice and technology, a standardized, evidence-based educational framework is essential. Future strategies should include interprofessional collaboration, AI-driven diagnostic support, and immersive simulation environments. Implementing these measures will enable clinicians to accurately interpret TMD imaging and improve patient care.',
