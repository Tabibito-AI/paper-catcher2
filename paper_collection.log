    title: 'Current and Emergent Economic Impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK Fresh\n' +
      '  Produce and Horticultural Businesses',
    summary: 'This paper describes a study designed to investigate the current and emergent\n' +
      'impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK horticultural businesses. Various\n' +
      'characteristics of UK horticultural production, notably labour reliance and\n' +
      'import dependence, make it an important sector for policymakers concerned to\n' +
      'understand the effects of these disruptive events as we move from 2020 into\n' +
      '2021. The study design prioritised timeliness, using a rapid survey to gather\n' +
      'information from a relatively small (n = 19) but indicative group of producers.\n' +
      'The main novelty of the results is to suggest that a very substantial majority\n' +
      'of producers either plan to scale back production in 2021 (47%) or have been\n' +
      'unable to make plans for 2021 because of uncertainty (37%). The results also\n' +
      'add to broader evidence that the sector has experienced profound labour supply\n' +
      'challenges, with implications for labour cost and quality. The study discusses\n' +
      'the implications of these insights from producers in terms of productivity and\n' +
      'automation, as well as in terms of broader economic implications. Although\n' +
      'automation is generally recognised as the long-term future for the industry\n' +
      '(89%), it appeared in the study as the second most referred short-term option\n' +
      '(32%) only after changes to labour schemes and policies (58%). Currently,\n' +
      "automation plays a limited role in contributing to the UK's horticultural\n" +
      'workforce shortage due to economic and socio-political uncertainties. The\n' +
      'conclusion highlights policy recommendations and future investigative\n' +
      'intentions, as well as suggesting methodological and other discussion points\n' +
      'for the research community.',

    title: 'Modelling the emergence of spatial patterns of economic activity',
    summary: 'Understanding how spatial configurations of economic activity emerge is\n' +
      'important when formulating spatial planning and economic policy. A simple model\n' +
      'was proposed by Simon, who assumed that firms grow at a rate proportional to\n' +
      'their size, and that new divisions of firms with certain probabilities relocate\n' +
      "to other firms or to new centres of economic activity. Simon's model produces\n" +
      'realistic results in the sense that the sizes of economic centres follow a Zipf\n' +
      'distribution, which is also observed in reality. It lacks realism in the sense\n' +
      'that mechanisms such as cluster formation, congestion (defined as an overly\n' +
      'high density of the same activities) and dependence on the spatial distribution\n' +
      'of external parties (clients, labour markets) are ignored.\n' +
      '  The present paper proposed an extension of the Simon model that includes both\n' +
      'centripetal and centrifugal forces. Centripetal forces are included in the\n' +
      'sense that firm divisions are more likely to settle in locations that offer a\n' +
      'higher accessibility to other firms. Centrifugal forces are represented by an\n' +
      'aversion of a too high density of activities in the potential location. The\n' +
      'model is implemented as an agent-based simulation model in a simplified spatial\n' +
      'setting. By running both the Simon model and the extended model, comparisons\n' +
      'are made with respect to their effects on spatial configurations. To this end a\n' +
      'series of metrics are used, including the rank-size distribution and indices of\n' +
      'the degree of clustering and concentration.',

    title: 'Evolution of family systems and resultant socio-economic structures',
    summary: 'Families form the basis of society, and anthropologists have characterised\n' +
      'various family systems. This study developed a multi-level evolutionary model\n' +
      'of pre-industrial agricultural societies to simulate the evolution of family\n' +
      'systems and determine how each of them adapts to environmental conditions and\n' +
      'forms a characteristic socio-economic structure. In the model, competing\n' +
      'societies evolve, which themselves comprise multiple evolving families that\n' +
      'grow through family labour. Each family has two strategy parameters: the time\n' +
      'children leave the parental home and the distribution of inheritance among\n' +
      'siblings. The evolution of these parameters demonstrates that four basic family\n' +
      'systems emerge; families can become either nuclear or extended, and have either\n' +
      'an equal or unequal inheritance distribution. Nuclear families emerge where\n' +
      'land resources are sufficient, whereas extended families emerge where land\n' +
      'resources are limited. Equal inheritance emerges where the amount of wealth\n' +
      'required for a family to survive is large, whereas unequal inheritance emerges\n' +
      'where the required wealth is small. Analyses on the wealth distribution of\n' +
      'families demonstrate a higher level of poverty in extended families, and that\n' +
      'the accumulation of wealth is accelerated for unequal inheritance. By comparing\n' +
      'wealth distributions in the model with historical data, family systems are\n' +
      'associated with characteristic economic structures and modern social\n' +
      'ideologies. Empirical data analyses using the cross-cultural ethnographic\n' +
      'database verify the theoretical relationship between the environmental\n' +
      'conditions, family systems, and socio-economic structures. Theoretical studies\n' +
      'by this simple constructive model, as presented here, will integrate the\n' +
      'understandings of family systems in evolutionary anthropology, demography, and\n' +
      'socioeconomic histories.',

    title: 'In the Shadow of Smith`s Invisible Hand: Risks to Economic Stability and\n' +
      '  Social Wellbeing in the Age of Intelligence',
    summary: 'Work is fundamental to societal prosperity and mental health, providing\n' +
      'financial security, identity, purpose, and social integration. The emergence of\n' +
      'generative artificial intelligence (AI) has catalysed debate on job\n' +
      'displacement. Some argue that many new jobs and industries will emerge to\n' +
      'offset the displacement, while others foresee a widespread decoupling of\n' +
      'economic productivity from human input threatening jobs on an unprecedented\n' +
      'scale. This study explores the conditions under which both may be true and\n' +
      'examines the potential for a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures\n' +
      'that would necessitate sustained government intervention to maintain job\n' +
      'security and economic stability. A system dynamics model was developed to\n' +
      'undertake ex ante analysis of the effect of AI-capital deepening on labour\n' +
      'underutilisation and demand in the economy. Results indicate that even a\n' +
      'moderate increase in the AI-capital-to-labour ratio could increase labour\n' +
      'underutilisation to double its current level, decrease per capita disposable\n' +
      'income by 26% (95% interval, 20.6% - 31.8%), and decrease the consumption index\n' +
      'by 21% (95% interval, 13.6% - 28.3%) by mid-2050. To prevent a reduction in per\n' +
      'capita disposable income due to the estimated increase in underutilization, at\n' +
      'least a 10.8-fold increase in the new job creation rate would be necessary.\n' +
      'Results demonstrate the feasibility of an AI-capital- to-labour ratio threshold\n' +
      'beyond which even high rates of new job creation cannot prevent declines in\n' +
      'consumption. The precise threshold will vary across economies, emphasizing the\n' +
      'urgent need for empirical research tailored to specific contexts. This study\n' +
      'underscores the need for governments, civic organisations, and business to work\n' +
      'together to ensure a smooth transition to an AI- dominated economy to safeguard\n' +
      'the Mental Wealth of nations.',

      '  computational economic analysis',
    summary: 'Our computational economic analysis investigates the relationship between\n' +

    summary: 'We propose a high level network architecture for an economic system that\n' +

      'and redeeming a digital coin using a mechanism to create a sustainable global\n' +

      'therefore be money proper, we claim it must be issued by the buyer and backed\n' +

    title: 'Structural Change, Employment, and Inequality in Europe: an Economic\n' +
      '  Complexity Approach',
    summary: 'Structural change consists of industrial diversification towards more\n' +
      'productive, knowledge intensive activities. However, changes in the productive\n' +
      'structure bear inherent links with job creation and income distribution. In\n' +
      'this paper, we investigate the consequences of structural change, defined in\n' +
      'terms of labour shifts towards more complex industries, on employment growth,\n' +
      'wage inequality, and functional distribution of income. The analysis is\n' +
      'conducted for European countries using data on disaggregated industrial\n' +
      'employment shares over the period 2010-2018. First, we identify patterns of\n' +
      'industrial specialisation by validating a country-industry industrial\n' +
      'employment matrix using a bipartite weighted configuration model (BiWCM).\n' +
      'Secondly, we introduce a country-level measure of labour-weighted Fitness,\n' +
      'which can be decomposed in such a way as to isolate a component that identifies\n' +
      'the movement of labour towards more complex industries, which we define as\n' +
      'structural change. Thirdly, we link structural change to i) employment growth,\n' +
      'ii) wage inequality, and iii) labour share of the economy. The results indicate\n' +
      'that our structural change measure is associated negatively with employment\n' +
      'growth. However, it is also associated with lower income inequality. As\n' +
      'countries move to more complex industries, they drop the least complex ones, so\n' +
      'the (low-paid) jobs in the least complex sectors disappear. Finally, structural\n' +
      'change predicts a higher labour ratio of the economy; however, this is likely\n' +
      'to be due to the increase in salaries rather than by job creation.',

    title: 'Workforce migration and its economic implications: A perspective from\n' +
      '  social media in China',
    summary: 'The workforce remains the most basic element of social production, even in\n' +
      'modern societies. Its migration, especially for developing economies such as\n' +
      'China, plays a strong role in the reallocation of productive resources and\n' +
      'offers a promising proxy for understanding socio-economic issues. Nevertheless,\n' +
      'due to long cycle, expensive cost and coarse granularity, conventional surveys\n' +
      'face challenges in comprehensively profiling it. With the permeation of smart\n' +
      'and mobile devices in recent decades, booming social media has essentially\n' +
      'broken spatio-temporal constraints and enabled the continuous sensing of the\n' +
      'real-time mobility of massive numbers of individuals. In this study, we\n' +
      'demonstrate that similar to a natural shock, the Spring Festival culturally\n' +
      'drives workforce travel between workplaces and hometowns, and the trajectory\n' +
      'footprints from social media therefore open a window with unparalleled richness\n' +
      'and fine granularity to explore laws in national-level workforce migration. To\n' +
      'understand the core driving forces of workforce migration flux between cities\n' +

      'introduced into our prediction model. We find that urban GDP (gross domestic\n' +
      'product) and travel time are two excellent indicators to help make predictions.\n' +
      'Diverse migration patterns are then revealed by clustering the trajectories,\n' +
      'which give important clues to help understand the different roles of Chinese\n' +
      'cities in their own development and in regional economic development. These\n' +
      'patterns are further explained as a joint effect of the subjective will to seek\n' +
      'personal benefits and the capacity requirements of local labour markets. Our\n' +

    title: 'The economics of diversity: Innovation, productivity and the labour market',
    abstract: 'The empirical evidence on the economic impacts of diversity is mixed. Many studies in the literature present context dependent and data driven results which are challenging to reconcile with each other. This paper offers a systematic synthesis of the empirical findings on the economic impacts of diversity on innovation, productivity, and the labour market. It presents a structured framework which takes the spatial scale of the analysis in the papers as a reference to understand the inconsistency of some previous predictions and the varying magnitudes of the diversity impact. The empirical findings reconcile more meaningfully when diversity effects are documented discretely at the regional, firm and individual levels. The paper further sets out an agenda for future research and links the findings for policy relevance.',

    title: 'The future of the standard employment relationship: Labour law, new institutional economics and old power resource theory',
    abstract: 'This article addresses two questions about the standard employment relationship that have become prominent in labour law literature: Does it exacerbate inequality? Is its decline inevitable? The focus is on the second question and emphasizes the extent to which the standard employment relationship was both embedded in, and the outcome of, an institutional ensemble that was fashioned out of the post-war capital–labour compromise in industrialized democracies. The analysis proceeds in three steps. The first is conceptual and stresses the distinctive nature of labour as a fictive commodity, and the recurring regulatory dilemmas that arise in any attempt to institutionalize a labour market. The second step historicizes and contextualizes the employment relationship, emphasizing politics and conflict (power resource theory) over rational choice and coordination (new institutional economics) as the basis for its institutionalization. The emphasis on politics, power and labour leads to the third step, which focuses on how the broad process of financialization influences three key institutions – the large manufacturing firm, the democratic welfare state and autonomous trade unions – that have been crucial for the development of the standard employment relationship.',

    abstract: 'The implications of the capability approach for the positive and normative analysis of labour law are considered in this chapter. It is argued that the capability approach does not offer a complete theory of labour law and does not, in itself, provide substantive guidance for labour law reform, but that it offers a distinct ontological and methodological perspective which can help to reframe the debate over the economic effects of labour law. In its emphasis on the importance of institutions for creating the conditions for human freedom, and in its advocacy of a range of indicators of human well-being beyond those based on economic growth alone, the capability approach underpins the idea that labour law can play a role in creating the conditions for sustainable development.',

    title: 'The new economics of labour migration and the role of remittances in the migration process.',
    abstract: '\n' +
      " This analysis considers international migration remittances and their impact on development in migrant-sending areas. The new economics of labor migration (NELM) posit that remittances lessen production and market constraints faced by households in poor developing countries. The article states that remittances may be a positive factor in economic development, which should be nurtured by economic policies. The impact of remittances and migration on development varies across locales and is influenced by migrants' remittance behavior and by economic contexts. Criteria for measuring development gains may include assessments of income growth, inequity, and poverty alleviation. It is hard to gauge the level of remittances, especially when remittances may not flow through formal banking systems. The International Monetary Fund distinguishes between worker remittances sent home for over 1 year; employee compensation including the value of in-kind benefits for under 1 year; and the net worth of migrants who move between countries. This sum amounted to under $2 billion in 1970 and $70 billion in 1995. The cumulative sum of remittances, employee compensation, and transfers was almost $1 trillion, of which almost 66% was worker remittances, 25% was employee compensation, and almost 10% was transfers during 1980-95. Total world remittances surpass overseas development assistance. Remittances are unequally distributed across and between countries. Migration research does not adequately reveal the range and complexity of impacts. Push factors can limit options for use of remittances to stimulate development.\n",

    title: 'The New Economics of Labour Migration (NELM): Econometric Analysis of Remittances from Italy to Rural Bangladesh Based on Kinship Relation',
    abstract: 'This paper analysed the household head relation to the migrant and remittances determinants among ten villages on the remittances receiving households in rural Bangladesh. The household survey data from Bangladesh for the period of July to December, 2013, to analyse determinants of remittances at the left behind household members. Rather than multilevel models, use a three stages backward regressions elimination estimation process and build up econometric best fit model of remittances, which helps us the focus the analysis on the explanation of remittances determinants heterogeneity in micro-economic level of studies. The empirical findings suggest that the household head relation to the migrant is one of the strong determinants of remittances as well as other variables. In addition, the household head relation to migrant such a father, mother, brother and wife also have different influential factors while the most common variable as number of visit by the migrant at the origin is strongly associates with all the relationship to the migrant although level of significance has slightly discrimination. Overall, the findings suggests that the age of migrant are strongly associates with father, wife and brother relation of the household head while the age of household head as father and wife. The investment in housing development strongly associates wife, brother and mother household head whereas household living expenses with father and wife. Individual determinants such as household income, land and marital status of the migrant are strongly associates with father, wife and mother household head respectively.',

Written by 2015 Nobel Laureate Angus Deaton and John Muellbauer, the book begins with a self-contained presentation of the basic theory and its use in applied econometrics. These early chapters also include elementary extensions of the theory to labour supply, durable goods, the consumption function, and rationing. The rest of the book is divided into three parts. In the first of these the authors discuss restrictions on choice and aggregation problems. The next part consists of chapters on consumer index numbers; household characteristics, demand, and household welfare comparisons; and social welfare and inequality. The last part extends the coverage of consumer behaviour to include the quality of goods and household production theory, labour supply and human capital theory, the consumption function and intertemporal choice, the demand for durable goods, and choice under uncertainty.',

    title: "The Economics of Long‐Term Contracts in the Footballers' Labour Market",
    abstract: `type="main" xml:id="sjpe12064-abs-0001"> Peter Sloane's seminal article in this journal on the objectives of football clubs argued that utility maximising clubs would seek out player talent more aggressively than profit maximising clubs and that this accumulation of player talent by larger teams might need to be checked by redistribution of revenues. We suggest in this article that, in a context of rising revenues and high rewards, the pressures to acquire more and better talent so as to out-perform other teams on the football pitch leads to a requirement for teams to practise effective contract management. Using a large dataset from the German Bundesliga, we find that players with longer term contracts perform better, ceteris paribus. Hence, selection effects in the award of long-term contracts dominate moral hazard (shirking) effects in the Bundesliga.`,

The article distinguishes between ‘economic analysis of law’ and ‘law and economics’, with the former applying economic models to generally simple legal rules while the latter blends messier institutional detail with legal and economic thought. The article describes three eras of law-and-economics scholarship, recognizing that economics teaches that markets work and markets fail. Era One emphasizes that labour laws and mandatory employment rules might reduce overall social welfare by preventing a benefit or term from going to the party that values it most highly. Era Two emphasizes that labour and employment laws might enhance overall social welfare by correcting market failures arising from monopsony power, externalities, public goods, asymmetric information, information-processing heuristics, and internal labour markets. Era Three uses empirical methods to referee between markets-work and markets-fail approaches. The article argues that unequal bargaining power is not a standard market failure, because even powerful employers have a profit-maximizing motive to provide benefits, such as vacation or safety, that workers are willing to pay for.',

    title: 'Cellular dynamics of cervical remodelling: insights from preterm and term labour',
    summary: 'Introduction Preterm birth remains a global health challenge with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Despite extensive research, the underlying mechanisms triggering preterm birth remain elusive, needing a deeper understanding of cervical cellular remodelling processes. Purpose This study aims to elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying cervical remodelling in spontaneous preterm labour (PTL) compared to term labour (TL), focusing on the roles of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study from October 2018 to March 2021, at two hospitals. Participants were categorized into two groups: PTL ( n  = 14), TL ( n  = 14). A small set ( n  = 6) of preterm not in labour (PTnotL) was also included. Cervical biopsies were obtained and analysed for the density of fibroblasts and inflammatory cells (neutrophils and mononuclear cells) using digital image analysis. Statistical analysis was performed employing Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Results There was no significant overall difference in global inflammatory cell density between PTL and TL ( p  = 0.154). However, a detailed analysis revealed significantly higher inflammation in the exocervix of PTL compared to TL, particularly involving neutrophils ( p  = 0.021) and mononuclear cells ( p  = 0.028). Neutrophils ( p  = 0.035), but not mononuclear cells ( p  = 0.111), were significantly decreased in PTnotL exocervix compared to PTL. No differences were found in inflammatory cell density in the endocervix. Fibroblast densities were similar across groups. Conclusions This study highlights the distinct cellular profiles in the cervix during preterm and term labour, with neutrophils playing a pivotal role in preterm labour. These findings may guide the development of targeted interventions to prevent preterm birth.',

    title: 'Gender-Based Discrimination in Care Service Occupations: Result from an Online Experiment',
    summary: 'In this study, we conducted an online experiment to investigate the effect of masculine and feminine gender expression on hiring in care service occupations. Participants were presented with fictional hiring scenarios and workers’ profiles and photos, which were manipulated to appear distinctively masculine or feminine. For personal care services, we found that Asian masculine photo and Black feminine photo received the highest interview selection rates, while White feminine photo received the lowest. The typical gap was about 10–20 percentage points, equivalent to a 30–50% increase, and in the same order of magnitude as having one additional year of experience or having a community college degree. Our mediation analysis suggests that this effect was mediated by perceived gender expression and race and moderated by workers’ racial identity and the hiring occupation, but there are residual differences attributable to idiosyncratic features of the photos. While alternative explanations cannot be entirely ruled out, our findings are consistent with diminishing marginal return to masculinity and indicative that the social organization of care is not only gendered but also racialized.',

    title: 'Therapies for Advanced Parkinson’s Disease in Sweden: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Using Real-World Data',
    summary: 'Introduction The Swedish Parkinson’s Disease (PD) Registry provides rich data on cost and quality of life for patients receiving device-aided therapies (DATs) for Parkinson’s disease in Sweden. This study sought to use this real-world evidence to determine the cost-effectiveness profile of specific DATs in Sweden. Methods We developed a state transition (Markov) model to represent disease progression over time and used published clinical data to represent short- and long-term disease outcomes. We used data from the Swedish PD Registry to assign costs and quality of life measures (utilities) to each health state and modelled total costs and outcomes over a 20-year time horizon. The four treatment groups modelled were: best medical therapy, deep brain stimulation, levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel, and continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion. We calculated results from both payer and societal perspectives. Results The most cost-effective intervention was deep brain stimulation (DBS), which dominated all other interventions. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the key drivers of uncertainty were the transition probabilities between successive Hoehn and Yahr stages on each treatment. Results were consistent from both payer and societal perspectives. Conclusion DBS is a cost-effective use of resources in Sweden. However, uncertainty remains regarding long-term symptom control as well as quality of life within specific health states for all device-aided therapies, and further data are needed to fully validate the model projections and provide more insight into areas of future research.',

    title: 'Soil Water Balance and Productivity of Different Maize-Based Crop Sequences Compared to Rice–Wheat System under Contrasting Irrigation Regimes in North–West India',
    summary: 'An efficient management of water resources is considered essential for increased irrigation water productivity and for long-term sustainability of cropland ecosystems. In north-western India, the widespread adoption of conventional irrigation practices within water-intensive cropping systems like “rice-wheat” has led to frightening levels of water shortage and meager economic benefits. Diversified cropping systems, or producing different crops on the same piece of land at once, can increase revenue potential besides saving of irrigation water. Diversified cropping systems can help ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of agricultural operations, which can ultimately improve the livelihood of farmers. In this regard, this study aims to compare three maize-based crop sequences with rice–wheat system under different irrigation regimes. Specifically, rice equivalent yield, water balance, water productivity and net returns were assessed for different cropping systems under varied irrigation regimes. The study findings demonstrate significantly higher rice equivalent yield in maize– gobhi sarson– summer moong sequence under I 1.25 , I 1.0 and conventional irrigation scheduling practice besides saving of ~ 687.5, 462.5 and 800 mm of irrigation water, respectively, compared to the rice–wheat sequence established under conventional irrigation scheduling. The cropping sequence with oilseeds and pulses as component crops, i.e., maize– gobhi sarson –summer moong and maize–potato–mentha + onion has ~ 1.85-times higher water use efficiency under I 1.25 as compared to the R–W cropping under conventional irrigation scheduling. The R–W cropping sequence under conventional irrigation regime resulted in the lowest average net returns compared with maize-based crop sequences established under I 1.25 and the conventional irrigation regime.',

    title: 'Energy storage systems for carbon neutrality: Challenges and opportunities',
    summary: 'In recent years, improvements in energy storage technology, cost reduction, and the increasing imbalance between power grid supply and demand, along with new incentive policies, have highlighted the benefits of battery energy storage systems. These systems offer long life, low cost, and high energy conversion efficiency. While energy storage is gradually transitioning from demonstration projects to commercial operations, its technical and economic performance is still limited, and it lacks economies of scale. Research on the design and operational optimization of energy storage systems is crucial for advancing project demonstrations and commercial applications. Therefore, this paper aims to provide insights into system configuration and operational optimization. It first summarizes the optimal configuration of energy storage technology for the grid side, user side, and renewable energy generation. It then analyzes and reviews the economic optimization and cybersecurity challenges in power system operations. Finally, this paper discusses unresolved issues in energy storage applications and highlights important considerations for future implementation and expansion.',

    title: 'Trajectory of quality of life among patients with cancer at the end of life: a longitudinal survey study',
    summary: 'Purpose Measuring and understanding the determinants of HRQoL is essential to the delivery of effective and high-quality end-of-life (EoL) care to patients with cancer. Despite this, the evidence base remains sparse and with much of the existing literature relying on data from cross-sectional studies and clinical trials. Aim The objective of this study was to describe HRQoL in a population of patients with cancer leading up till death using both the generic preference-based scale European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level Version and the disease-specific scale European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. Methods Using a longitudinal prospective study design, HRQoL data was collected in four waves over the course of one year. The population consisted of all patients who received cancer-targeted drug treatment at the Department of Oncology at Odense University Hospital, Denmark. Only patients who died during the data collection period were included. Results HRQoL in patients with cancer was stable for most months and close to the level of the general Danish population at the same age but deteriorated considerably in the last three months of life. The same pattern was observed for both HRQoL scales. Conclusion Despite current efforts to deliver high-quality EoL care to patients with cancer, we see a general decrease in HRQoL in the months leading up to death. The generic and disease-specific HRQoL scales do capture different dimensions of HRQoL which also, by construct, are weighted differently in the two approaches.',

    title: 'Capacity planning in open-pit mines under economies of scale and block sequence considerations',
    summary: 'Capacity planning is a particular problem in the minerals industry because it depends on the heterogeneity and accessibility of the ore in the deposit, as well as on demand. If the ore is uniformly distributed within the deposit, capacity planning will be a function of project financing and demand. However, in many deposits, the ore is unevenly distributed, and it is not possible to access the ore as desired. Overlying ore and waste, considering slope angles, should be extracted earlier to access specific ore locations. Also, measuring the degree of EoS, the ratio of variable costs to total cost, called the “capacity factor,” also affects capacity planning. This research explores the critical relationship capacity planning, block sequencing, and economies of scale (EoS). By integrating EoS into a comprehensive cost-capacity relationship framework, a novel model that enhances traditional mine planning methodologies is proposed. A case study of an old gold deposit demonstrates the proposed model’s practical applicability. Results show that lower capacity factors (i.e., high fixed and low variable operating costs) for mining systems associated with large-capacity mining equipment significantly enhance net present value (NPV) compared to small-capacity equipment. On the other hand, the capacity factor for mineral processing systems has a less significant effect on NPV maximization when compared with the mining capacity factor. This emphasizes that the importance of EoS in mining systems is higher than in mineral processing systems. Even though the analysis suggests that the optimum capacity and the related NPV vary with different degrees of EoS, NPV is maximized with lower capacity factors for the mining system and moderate capacity factors for the mineral processing system. This observation highlights the critical need for accurate estimation of fixed and variable costs, as well as the degree of EoS, for a project.',

    title: 'Supporting Early Childhood Development through Multi-dimensional Service Delivery in South Africa',
    summary: 'There is a growing call to reduce environmental risk factors for children in LMICs and to provide children and parents in these places with the services they need to promote healthy development. In aid of this, we create an index of multidimensional service delivery for children in a developing country context. This approach is motivated by the consensus in the literature that early childhood development (ECD) is multidimensional in nature, and that children need multiple inputs at the same time for healthy development. The index is created using South African data, and shows that the full complement of the services is not adequately provided in any municipality in South Africa. Following on from this, a first validation is provided by assessing whether the constructed ECD services index is associated with individual child outcomes. The analysis reveals that the index is statistically significantly associated with child cognitive outcomes, and specifically, that public infrastructure service delivery is positively related to cognitive outcomes in children who attend an ELP in South Africa. This is consistent with the hypothesis that interventions which supplement child nutrition and the home environment have a larger positive impact than those which focus only on one element of development such as cognitive stimulation. This initial validation suggests that this index is useful to measure the compliment of services that children need to develop healthily.',

    summary: 'This study investigates the impact of unemployment, household income and expenditure, globalisation, and foreign direct investment (FDI) on child labour across 37 African countries from 2010 to 2021, employing panel and multiple linear regression models. The findings reveal diverse impacts: rising unemployment significantly increased child labour in countries like Ethiopia and Niger, while in Cameroon and Kenya, it had a negative effect. Globalisation’s influence varied, strongly reducing child labour in Ghana but exacerbating it in Burundi. Household income and expenditure generally reduced child labour, particularly in Ethiopia and Zambia. The effect of FDI was also mixed, decreasing child labour in Madagascar but increasing it in countries with weaker governance. These insights underscore the necessity for tailored, country-specific policies that consider local economic conditions and governance quality. Future efforts to combat child labour must focus on developing sustainable solutions that address these complex dynamics.',

    title: 'The Effect of Emotional Labour on Job Dedication Among Early Childhood Teachers in the UAE: The Mediating Role of Teaching Self-Efficacy',
    summary: 'Emotional labour is an important part of teaching. Teaching self-efficacy and job dedication are important parameters that influence teaching. Mixed findings have been reported on the link between emotional labour, teaching self-efficacy, and job dedication. This study examined the pattern of emotional labour performed by early childhood teachers, the relationship between emotional labour and job dedication, and the mediating effect of teaching self-efficacy on the relationship. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire survey from a convenience sample of 305 teachers from nurseries and kindergartens across the UAE. The mean comparison revealed that surface acting (M = 2.92) was performed significantly less frequently than deep acting (M = 3.90) and expression of naturally felt emotions (M = 4.19). Structural equation modeling with bootstrap mediation analysis revealed that expression of naturally felt emotions had a positive, direct effect on dedication (β = 0.43, p  = 0.012) and teaching self-efficacy (β = 0.84, p  = 0.002), and that teaching self-efficacy had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between expression of naturally felt emotions and job dedication, with an amount of indirect effect of 0.501 ( p  = 0.002) and mediating effect ratio of 54.10%. The implications of the results were discussed.',

    title: 'Long-run causal impact of the 2011 Economic Adjustment Programme on Portuguese population health.',
    abstract: 'In 2011, Portugal signed a bailout programme to be implemented over a 3-year period, from 2011 to mid-2014. This programme included a set of measures to control and reduce the public sector, which included interventions in areas such as public spending and financing, the labour market, education, and health, among other structural budget measures. The aim of this research is to determine the long-run causal impact of implementing this Economic Adjustment Programme on several population health outcomes. Data was collected for the period 1990-2019 for Portugal. Health outcome indicators account for DALY and HLY, among other general health indicators, but also for some specific mortality rates like those for stroke and cancer. Control variables include percentage of population older than 65, percentage of people with a university degree, CO2 emissions for Portugal, and also health outcomes data for Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The analytical method used is based on a Bayesian structural time series model, which builds a contrafactual scenario representing the absence of the Economic Adjustment Programme for comparison with observed data. The most significant result is the negative long-run causal impact arising from the implementation of the Economic Adjustment Programme in 2011 in Portugal; in other words, health improvements would have been better and faster had the bailout programme not been implemented, despite some level of uncertainty regarding the results. Findings reinforce the idea for the implementation of social and health policies that complement IMF bailout programmes to mitigate negative impacts on population health in the long-run.',

    title: 'Socio-medical factors associated with neurodevelopmental disorders on the Kenyan coast.',
    abstract: 'Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are a group of conditions with their onset during the early developmental period and include conditions such as autism and intellectual disability. Occurrence of NDDs is thought to be determined by both genetic and environmental factors, but data on the role of environmental factors for NDD in Africa is limited. This study investigates environmental influences on NDDs in children from Kenya. This case-control study compared children with NDDs and typically developing children from two studies on the Kenyan coast. We included 172 study participants from the Kilifi Autism study and 151 from the NeuroDev study who had a diagnosis of at least one NDD and 112 and 73 with no NDD diagnosis from each study, respectively. Potential risk factors were identified using unadjusted univariable analysis and adjusted multivariable logistic regression. Univariable analysis in the Kilifi Autism study sample revealed hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy conferred the largest odds ratio (OR) 10.52 [95%CI: 4.04, 27.41] for NDDs, followed by medical complications during pregnancy (gestational hypertension & diabetes, eclampsia, maternal bleeding) (OR=3.17 [95%CI: 1.61, 6.23]). In the NeuroDev study sample, labour and birth complications (OR=7.30 [95%CI 2.17, 24.61]), neonatal jaundice (OR=5.49 [95%CI 1.61,18.72]) and infection during pregnancy (OR= 5.31 [95%CI 1.56, 18.11]) conferred the largest risk associated with NDDs. In the adjusted analysis, seizures before age 3 years in the Kilifi Autism study and labour and birth complications in the NeuroDev study conferred the largest increased risk. Higher parity, the child being older and delivery at home were associated with a reduced risk for NDDs. Recognition of important risk factors such as labour and birth complications could guide preventative interventions, developmental screening of at-risk children and monitoring progress of these children. Further studies examining the aetiology of NDDs in population-based samples, including investigating the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, are needed.',

    title: 'Estimating wage disparities using foundation models.',
    abstract: 'The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are trained on massive datasets before being adjusted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is fine-tuned in the standard way: to minimize predictive error. We then provide a set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are [Formula: see text]-consistent. Based on this theory, we develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage gap estimation. Classical methods for estimating the adjusted wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages, which can induce omitted variable bias because they condition on coarse summaries of career history. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model, capturing a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the gap.',

    title: 'Experiences of vaginal examination by pregnant women during labour: A cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: "Giving birth is undoubtedly one of the most important experiences in women's lives. It is critical to provide technically competent care and improve women's care experiences to provide quality care during labour. This study was undertaken to determine the factors affecting vaginal examination (VE) experiences of women during labor. The descriptive and correlational study was conducted with 213 postpartum women who gave birth vaginally. Data were collected using a Descriptive Data Form and the Women's Experiences of Vaginal Examinations in Labor Scale (WEVEL). The mean score of the postpartum women on the total WEVEL score was 66.6±4.8. A significant negative relationship was found between postpartum mothers' VE experiences and the frequency of VEs' and the level of discomfort during VE (r=-0.33), while a positive relationship was shown with the level of the person performing VE (r=0.38) (p<0.01). Factors explaining 25.7% of VE experiences were the level of discomfort during VE and the level of the person performing VE. We conclude that the level of discomfort during VE and the level of the person performing VE were significant predictors of women's VE experiences, with the former having a positive and the latter a negative effect.",

    title: "There's never been a better time to be a STEM educator.",
    abstract: "From its current vantage point, the future of US STEM education may appear bleak. Yet STEM education's strength and importance have never been greater, and evidence points to a bright future. This case can be made by drawing on the United State's identity as the world's most entrepreneurial nation. The optimistic outlook for STEM education is framed here through the lens of product-market fit-an economics concept describing how well-aligned products and market forces can generate self-sustaining demand. An analysis of these forces suggests that US STEM education has not only achieved this fit but surpassed it. The nation's strategic interests drive unmet demand for a well-prepared STEM workforce. Course-based research and inquiry-based teaching offer a superior educational model that can scale nationally. Life sciences, in particular, can combine broad student reach with low-cost DNA sequencing to create a multidisciplinary platform for education and research. As a grateful recipient of the Genetics Society of America's Elizabeth W. Jones Award, I reflect on how the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory DNA Learning Center (DNALC) has operated at the intersection of these forces-developing infrastructure and approaches that are widely adopted and poised for expanded distribution. Meeting the nation's urgent need requires bold investment and broad engagement. By seizing this moment, we can make now the best time to be a STEM educator.",

    title: 'Community-level determinants of loneliness and social isolation: a population-based cohort study across younger and older adults.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Loneliness and social isolation (SI) are critical public health issues with well-documented effects on health and well-being. However, much of existing observational and intervention research has focused predominantly on individual-and interpersonal-level factors. This longitudinal study addresses significant knowledge gaps by comprehensively examining the independent influence of multiple community-level determinants on loneliness and SI and uniquely comparing these effects across younger (18-30 year) and older (60 + years) adults within an Australian population cohort over a 12-year period.\n' +
      'METHODS: Using longitudinal data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, we analysed data from four wave pairs (2006/07, 2010/11, 2014/15, 2018/19) to investigate associations between loneliness and SI and nine community and neighbourhood-level variables. We employed lagged mixed-effects Poisson regression models to calculate risk ratios (RR) adjusted for individual-and interpersonal-level factors.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Our findings reveal that low community engagement is the strongest risk factor for loneliness and SI in both younger (Loneliness, RR = 1.34; SI, RR = 1.58) and older populations (Loneliness, RR = 1.35; SI = 2.02). Low neighbourhood social cohesion was found to significantly increase loneliness and SI in older adults (Loneliness, RR = 1.15; SI, RR = 1.36) and to increase SI in younger adults (RR = 1.54). We also observed distinct age-specific effects, with cultural practices, altruism, and perceived neighbourhood safety having differential impacts across age groups.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the critical need for community-level interventions to address loneliness and SI, suggesting that focusing solely on individual-related factors is insufficient. Tailoring public health strategies to enhance community dynamics may be essential in reducing loneliness and SI among vulnerable populations, particularly in areas with low social cohesion and community engagement offerings.',

    title: 'Economic implications of artificial intelligence-driven recommended systems in healthcare: a focus on neurological disorders.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven recommendation systems in healthcare presents significant economic implications, particularly in the context of neurological disorders. These systems offer opportunities to enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and improve patient outcomes. However, conventional economic models fail to address the dynamic complexities of AI integration in healthcare, including market inefficiencies and stakeholder behaviors.\n' +
      'METHODS: To bridge this gap, we propose a Dynamic Equilibrium Model for Health Economics (DEHE), incorporating reinforcement learning and stochastic optimization. This model captures uncertainty in healthcare decision-making and includes dynamic pricing, behavioral incentives, and adaptive insurance premium mechanisms.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Our experimental results demonstrate that DEHE improves economic efficiency by optimizing AI-driven recommendations while balancing healthcare cost and accessibility. Through multi-agent simulations, the model shows strong real-world applicability and stability. It effectively addresses asymmetric information, moral hazard, and market dynamics.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: This study offers a novel economic framework for integrating AI-driven systems in neurological healthcare. We recommend the adoption of adaptive policy mechanisms and stakeholder-specific incentives to enhance cost-effectiveness and equitable access. These insights contribute to the development of more sustainable and inclusive AI-based healthcare policies.',

    title: 'A structured comparison and reflection on international position statements and professional guidance for the management of periviable infants.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Survival rates and clinical approach to periviable infants are rapidly evolving at certain centres, but there remains variation in definition, approach and management of these infants worldwide. This review aims to narratively review and discuss professional guidelines, position statements and frameworks for management of periviable infants (22 + 0-25 + 0 weeks gestation) born in countries with the highest relative spending on healthcare.\n' +
      'METHODS: Eligible countries were determined using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development database. The top 10 countries with highest spend on healthcare as a proportion of their gross domestic profit were selected. A comprehensive search of relevant databases and search engines (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Google Scholar) was performed to identify professional guidance documents for each eligible country. The primary outcome was the delivery room management recommendation (survival-focused or end of life care). The secondary outcomes were survival rates, disability rates and whether shared decision-making with parents was recommended.\n' +
      'RESULTS: There was variation in definition of periviable and approach to management across the 10 professional guidelines. There was a four-week difference across countries for where the limits of viability lie (22 + 0-25 + 6 weeks). At 22-weeks, eight guidelines recommended comfort care and only one country recommending active care as the default management position at birth. By 24-weeks gestation, no country recommended comfort care as the standard approach at birth.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: Despite the included countries having the highest spend on healthcare as a proportion of their GDP, there is marked international variation in recommended practice in relation to the definition of and management for periviable infants. The majority of included guidelines recommended a shared decision-making approach between professionals and parents facing periviable birth, however, there were scant details about how this should be actualized and only two guidelines included decision-making aids for use with parents. The pre-birth discussion between perinatal professionals and parents facing periviable labour is complex and challenging for all involved. Further research is required to explore how best to facilitate parental understanding and involvement in these discussions to ensure parents are empowered to make the most appropriate decisions for their baby and their family.',

    title: 'Feasibility and Acceptability of a Novel Behavioral Economic Coaching Session to Address Physical Activity and TV Watching: An Open Pilot Trial.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Behavioral economics (BE) suggests that adults are more likely to engage in enjoyable behaviors that are easily available and accessible (e.g., TV watching) compared to less enjoyable and available alternatives (physical activity). This feasibility trial of a 4-week telehealth program aimed to increase physical activity and reduce TV watching.\n' +
      'METHOD: Healthy but insufficiently active adults who watched TV for at least 15 h/week (N = 33) were recruited via ResearchMatch and completed a baseline coaching session (~ 30 min), a booster session (week 2, ~ 15 min), and an exit interview via video conference (~ 15 min), as well as online questionnaires. The coaching session included common physical activity promotion strategies and two novel BE components to (1) increase the availability and enjoyment of physical activity, and (2) use TV watching as a reward for physical activity (i.e., contingent TV).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Most participants who attended the follow-up (87.5% out of n = 24) rated component 1 as "useful" or "very useful" and 45.8% rated contingent TV (component 2) as such. Four weeks post coaching session, participants reported an increase in vigorous physical activity (+ 13.9 min/day) and walking (+ 12.1 min/day), and a decrease in sedentary behavior other than TV watching (- 3.5 h/day).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This feasibility trial suggests that an individualized discussion on enjoyable physical activity and contingent TV watching are two behavioral economic approaches that may support behavior change in adults. Future research is needed to replicate these findings in a larger sample using a randomized controlled trial.',

    summary: 'This paper empirically investigates the distributional effects of the UK carbon price floor (CPF) on households’ electricity expenditure. I employ the difference-in-differences model to analyse the impact of the carbon price floor on vertical inequality. The main result finds that households in the poorest quintile are most impacted by the electricity price increase. I further explore the heterogenous effect on households within the bottom quintile by considering various household characteristics. This paper contributes to the existing literature on carbon pricing policies, in particular their impact on inequality both across income groups and within households in the poorest quintile.',

    summary: 'This is an accepted article with a DOI pre-assigned that is not yet published.Outcome bias is a pervasive phenomenon in decision-making, referring to the tendency to evaluate decisions made under identical circumstances as more favourable when it results in the desired outcome. This paper analyses this cognitive bias in the context of top-flight European football, examining whether a Bayesian updating model distorted by a multiplicative outcome bias is valid. Managers make significantly more changes to their strategy following a loss than a win, even having controlled for expected performance, in-game performance, and team and game-specific variation. The results of this paper are consistent with a positive-outcome bias, but not necessarily a multiplicative bias.',
