    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin\n' +
      'Longitudinal Study (WLS), I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment\n' +
      'predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when\n' +
      'respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about\n' +

      'covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status,\n' +
      'is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is\n' +
      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +
      'our understanding of longitudinal inequality and shed light on the sources of\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +
      'propose a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of\n' +
      'education and remains as a significant predictor of economic growth when tested\n' +
      'with both cross-section data and panel data. We argue that future research on\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Digital University: Building a Flexible, Inclusive, and Sustainable Education System',
    summary: "This paper explores the concept of a “Digital University” aimed at reshaping higher education to align with the needs of a digital economy. The study introduces a comprehensive model that integrates innovative digital solutions to enhance learning experiences, streamline university management, and develop core digital competencies among students. Using empirical data from five universities in Uzbekistan, the research examines the readiness of educational institutions to adopt digital infrastructure, faculty competencies in utilizing digital tools, and student satisfaction with technology-based learning. Findings indicate that digital integration positively influences educational outcomes, supporting the model's potential as a transformative approach in higher education. The study's novelty lies in its structural framework for a Digital University, emphasizing flexibility, inclusivity, and sustainability. This model not only enhances academic experiences but also positions universities to respond effectively to the growing demands of the digital economy.",

    title: 'Digitalization of Higher Education: Experience of Implementation',
    summary: 'In the article is considered the analysis of digitalization impact on the education system, the scientific view of its impact on the education system is analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of the impact of digitalization are revealed, the perspectives and trends of digitalization in the education system of the Republic of Uzbekistan are described. The beginning of the twenty-first century is due to the active implementation of digitalization processes in the modern economy. The digital economy touches every aspect of life: healthcare, education, online banking, and government. Modern Uzbekistan is a part of the world economic community, in this regard, the processes taking place in the international market require active entry into the global information community. For this purpose, Uzbekistan has paid special attention to the development of ICT since the early 1990s.

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Design, Psychometric Validation, and Network Analysis of the Evaluation Scale for Puberty Health Education Programs (EPHEP-Scale) for Students Aged 10-18.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Puberty health, as a fundamental aspect of adolescent health, requires targeted and evaluated educational programs. However, to date, a comprehensive tool to measure the effectiveness of these programs has not been developed. Therefore, this study aimed at the design and psychometric validation of the Evaluation Scale for Puberty Health Education Programs (EPHEP-Scale) for students aged 10-18.\n' +
      'METHOD: To develop and validate this scale, a sequential exploratory mixed-methods design was used. The samples included 850 students aged 10 to 18 from four Arab countries. The study also utilized Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) from a network perspective.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The results of the EFA and CFA showed that this scale includes six factors: Behavioral Reflexivity in Health Practices, Cognitive Resonance with Puberty, Transformative Impact on Self and Aspirations, Interpersonal Connectivity and Social Navigation, Emotional Synchrony and Adaptation, and Meta-Cognition and Reflective Learning. Additionally, network analysis further supported the six-factor structure of the EPHEP. These results indicate that the EPHEP-Scale is an accurate and reliable tool for evaluating puberty health education programs, making it suitable for use in various educational settings.\n' +
      'IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH POLICY, PRACTICE, AND EQUITY: The EPHEP-Scale offers policymakers and school health practitioners a culturally validated, equity-focused tool to assess and refine puberty health curricula. By capturing psychosocial and behavioral dimensions, it enables targeted resource allocation, particularly in resource-limited or culturally diverse settings, and promotes equitable evaluation of program impacts across gender and regional contexts. Adoption of this instrument can support data-driven policy decisions to enhance access, reduce stigma, and ensure that all students benefit from high-quality, contextually relevant puberty education.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: By providing a comprehensive framework to measure multiple aspects of puberty health development, the EPHEP enhances the effectiveness of these programs and enables their optimization for diverse student groups. With its broad impact on the design and implementation of educational initiatives, this scale plays a crucial role in improving the quality of life of puberties, as well as their mental and social well-being, ultimately fostering healthier and more informed generations across different communities.',

    title: "Women's health facility choices for antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care in Eastern Visayas, Philippines.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: This study aims to identify socioeconomic factors associated with the choice of antenatal care (ANC) facilities and to analyze trends in the utilization of health facilities for delivery and postnatal care (PNC) based on the type of ANC facility in Eastern Visayas, Philippines.\n' +
      'METHODS: This secondary data analysis uses baseline and one-year follow-up survey data from a quasi-experimental study conducted in September 2023 and 2024. Data from 1,414 women with information on maternal health facility utilization was analyzed. ANC facilities were categorized into four groups: Barangay Health Station (BHS), Rural Health Unit (RHU), hospital/clinic and others. Multinomial logistic regressions were applied, adjusting for socio-economic status and Barangay location, to examine associations between socio-economic factors and ANC facility choice, as well as trends in delivery and PNC facility utilization based on ANC facility type.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among 1,414 postpartum mothers, 35.6% received ANC at BHS, 34.1% at RHU, 32.7% at hospital/clinic, and 0.6% did not receive ANC. Most deliveries (83.3%) and PNC (61.4%) services occurred in hospital/clinic settings. Mothers who received ANC at a hospital/clinic were more likely to have higher education (aRRR = 7.04, 95% CI: 3.97, 12.50) and be wealthier (aRRR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.09, 3.69) compared to those who received ANC at BHS. Mothers receiving ANC at RHU (aRRR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.79) or hospital/clinic (aRRR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.78) were less likely to be single with a partner compared to those receiving ANC at BHS. Mothers who received ANC at hospital/clinic were more likely to deliver at a hospital/clinic (aRRR = 8.49, 95% CI: 3.56, 20.26) than at a RHU/BHS, and to receive PNC at a hospital/clinic (aRRR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.32, 3.24) instead of at a BHS, compared to those receiving ANC at BHS. Mothers receiving ANC at RHU were more likely to also receive PNC at an RHU (aRRR = 16.13, 95% CI: 7.80, 33.36) compared to those receiving ANC at BHS.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic disparities are associated with ANC facility choice, which in turn affects subsequent decisions regarding facilities for delivery and PNC in Eastern Visayas. As such, facility selection should be guided by healthcare needs rather than socioeconomic status.',

      "RESULTS: The model revealed significant associations between sex, SES, and maternal education with PPL. Compared with boys, girls presented a lower association with PPL [unstandardized beta coefficient [] = -1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.93 to -0.55,  < 0.001]. A higher SES was positively associated with greater PPL (medium SES:  = 1.76, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.70,  < 0.001; high SES:  = 2.34, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.45,  < 0.001), in comparison with those with lower SES. Additionally, maternal education level was positively associated with adolescents' PPL scores, with higher education levels linked to greater PPL ( = 1.48, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.55,  = 0.007). However, factors such as immigrant status, paternal education, family structure, number of siblings, type of schooling, and area of residence were not significantly associated with PPL ( > 0.05).\n" +

    title: 'Storage-Induced Collapse of Lignin Macromolecular Structure and Its Impacts on the Biorefinery.',
    abstract: "Lignin plays a vital role in the economics of biorefineries, serving as a source of process energy and a feedstock for sustainable fuels and chemical production. While understanding lignin's chemical composition is crucial, emerging evidence suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of its macromolecular structure is critical to explaining its complex behavior in the biorefinery. This study investigated the collapse of the lignin network in corn stover feedstock after harvest and storage as a result of the microbial digestion of hemicellulose. Fluorescence microscopy was used to detect the collapse of lignin by the changes in lignin's fluorescence lifetime, anisotropy, and the number of effective emitters. Our in situ microscopic results revealed lignin's coil-globule transition phenomena, which was only previously predicted by molecular dynamics modeling of extracted lignin in solvent. This collapse of lignin macromolecular structure was supported by results from NMR, IR, Raman, and powder X-ray diffraction. Our study revealed that the two major approaches for lignin valorization in the lignin-first biorefinery model, namely, monomer extraction and milled wood lignin extraction, were negatively impacted by the lignin collapse. As changes during storage are a source of feedstock variability, our study highlights the importance of understanding the effect of feedstock handling on biorefinery operations and economics.",

    title: 'Opioid Prescription Patterns in Hand Surgery: A Medicare Part D Analysis.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The opioid crisis continues to be a significant public health concern in the United States, with postoperative prescriptions contributing to the problem. Older adults face increased risks from opioid use, yet prescribing practices for hand surgery in the Medicare population remain understudied. This research aims to elucidate opioid prescription patterns among hand surgeons treating Medicare patients, focusing on national trends, regional variations, and gender differences.\n' +
      'METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program Prescribers Public Use File for hand surgeons from 2015 to 2019. National trends, regional variations based on US Census Bureau divisions, state-level differences, and gender disparities in opioid prescribing patterns were examined. Key metrics included opioid prescribing rates, proportion of opioid claims to total claims, average prescription duration, and total opioid claims per surgeon.\n' +
      'RESULTS: From 2015 to 2019, a total of 1752 hand surgeons were identified in the Medicare Part D database with a 5-year average of 231 405 opioid claims, comprising 53% of all claims made by hand surgeons. The median opioid prescribing rate decreased from 61.4% in 2015 to 55.3% in 2019. The proportion of opioid claims to total claims fell from 55.4% to 48.27%, and the average prescription duration decreased from 6.3 to 4.67 days. Significant regional and state-level variation was identified. Overall, the South had higher numbers of opioid prescriptions per hand surgeon and prescribed for more days compared with all other regions, but the Midwest and West regions had larger proportions of opioid claims.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Despite an overall decrease in opioid prescribing by hand surgeons for Medicare patients from 2015 to 2019, significant regional and gender-based variations persist. These findings underscore the need for standardized guidelines, improved prescriber education, and better integration of monitoring programs.',

    title: 'The Intersection of Caregiving and Financial Vulnerability: Empowerment Barriers for Women in Sex Work.',
    abstract: "This study explores the factors that shape the savings behaviors of women engaged in sex work (WESW) in southwestern Uganda, with a particular focus on the intersection of caregiving responsibilities and economic vulnerability. Drawing on qualitative data from the Kyaterekera study-an intervention that combined economic empowerment strategies (savings, financial literacy, and mentorship) with HIV risk reduction-we examine how WESW navigate financial decision-making in the context of structural and social constraints. While participants demonstrated motivation and resilience in pursuing financial stability, they encountered significant and intersecting barriers, including fluctuating income, caregiving demands, gendered norms, and the absence of formal social support systems. Findings reveal that caregiving is not merely a personal role but a structurally marginalized identity that shapes economic behavior in profound ways as these caregiving responsibilities intersect with factors such as marital status, household composition, and urban-rural location to produce differentiated financial challenges. Despite these constraints, participants engaged in strategic saving to meet essential needs, respond to emergencies, and invest in long-term goals such as homeownership and their children's education. These insights underscore the importance of adopting an intersectional approach to economic empowerment-one that accounts for the diverse and overlapping realities of WESW. Tailored interventions that integrate financial literacy, peer mentoring, and potentially self-help groups can more effectively address both individual and structural barriers. By centering caregiving within economic empowerment strategies, programs can better support the long-term financial autonomy and well-being of WESW and their families.",

    title: 'Mapping the Neuroeducation Landscape: A Bibliometric Analysis (2020-2025).',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Neuroeducation is an interdisciplinary area of study which combines insights of neuroscience, psychology, and education to enhance learning, using the body of scientific knowledge regarding the brain. Even though scholars have already investigated different details related to neuroeducation, thorough bibliometric research in the area remains absent.\n' +
      'SUMMARY: This review will provide a conceptual framework that will be used to analyse neuroeducation studies published in 2020-2025 on a medical database that would be accessed through Dimensions AI. The analyses involving VOSviewer of co-authorship, co-citation, and keywords in relation to 1,507 peer-reviewed articles were assessed. Key contributors, institutions, and theme clusters are suggested in the study. The United States, Canada and Spain became the leading contributors whereas such researchers as Antonopoulou Hera and Steve Masson made a significant contribution to the field.\n' +
      'KEY MESSAGE: The current bibliometric analysis gives us a vivid picture of the development of neuroeducation, its trends, and collaboration which can be used by educators, researchers, and policymakers when establishing the global network of research and filling the conceptual divide between neuroscience and practice in education.',

    title: 'How Art Museums Can Foster the Flourishing of Future Physicians.',
    abstract: "Medical schools are increasingly incorporating the arts and humanities into their curricula, often emphasizing their benefits in enhancing students' clinical skills. However, the potential for these curricula to foster flourishing is equally, if not more, crucial. Although limited in scope, current literature suggests that art museum-based medical education, particularly as Visual Thinking Strategies, may support flourishing among medical learners-although more research is needed to assess the impact of these methods and their mechanisms on learners. In this article, the authors explore how integrating art museum-based programs into medical school curricula can enhance all five domains of the VanderWeele model of human flourishing: physical and mental health, happiness and life satisfaction, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, and close social relationships.",
