    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Analyzing the User Experience of Virtual Pedagogy in Architecture Education',
    summary: 'This study aims to analyze the user experience of virtual pedagogy in architecture education. It seeks to gather valuable feedback and perceptions from teachers and students regarding the effectiveness, challenges, and benefits of virtual pedagogy. The study employs a quantitative research design using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the user experience, challenges, advantages, and overall satisfaction with virtual pedagogy in architecture education. The findings reveal the widespread use of tools and applications, such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and Zoom etc., for delivering both studio-based and non-studio-based courses in the virtual learning environment. The study highlights several challenges associated with virtual pedagogy, particularly for studio-based subjects, including the lack of in-person experience crucial for effective learning, difficulties in providing hands-on training, discouragement of active learning, and inadequate access to specialized tools and software. Additionally, the findings indicate that while virtual pedagogy offers flexibility and accessibility, it faces challenges in replicating the spontaneous interactions and hands-on nature of traditional in-person design studios.',

    title: 'The medical student stressor questionnaire (MSSQ): validation and reliability in Turkish students.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Medical training is a highly stressful environment for students. In previous studies, many instruments have been used to measure stress levels among medical students. However, these stress measurements are not specific tools for medical settings. This study aims to adapt the Medical Student Stressor Questionnaire (MSSQ) to Turkish, conduct validity and reliability studies, and provide a practical tool to evaluate medical school-related stressors of medical students in Turkey.\n' +
      `METHODS: All students studying at the (Manisa Celal Bayar University) School of Medicine were invited to the study. The data was collected between January-March 2024. The research was completed with 412 students. The MSSQ consists of 40 items and 6 subscales. The psychometric properties of the MSSQ were evaluated through tests for validity and reliability. Using RStudio version 1.3.1093 (R Studio, PBC) with the lavaan package, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with the "diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS)" estimator was conducted. Internal consistency was tested by Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest reliability was examined by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).\n` +
      'RESULTS: A total of 412 students participated in this study. The median (minimum-maximum) age of the students was found to be 20.00 (18.00-26.00) years. CFA was performed and the appropriate modification indices suggested by the model were added to the model. All 40 items loaded 0.38 or higher. The fit indices calculated as a result of the CFA were determined to be Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.060 (95% CI: 0.057-0.064)(p < 0.001), Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.899 and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.888. The fit indices were at acceptable level. In the analyses conducted for the subscales, the Cronbach Alpha Coefficients were adequate.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study has provided preliminary evidence for the validity and reliability of a Turkish version of the MSSQ. The six-factor structure was confirmed by CFA. We propose using the Turkish version of MSSQ to evaluate the stress level of medical students. Therefore, further research is needed to investigate the relationship between MSSQ and the other scales which used to measure stress.',

    title: 'Integration of early clinical exposure into curriculum enhances self-assessment of professional competencies in medical practice.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Medical education has predominantly adhered to a process-based education model. Recently, outcome-based education (OBE) has emerged as a dominant pedagogical framework, facilitating simultaneous acquisition of theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and clinical experience. In 2020, our medical school implemented a new curriculum designed to integrate clinical skills training and experiential learning with foundational knowledge from the first year. Herein, we evaluated whether the clinical competencies of New Curriculum Students (NCS) are superior to the clinical competencies of Traditional Curriculum Students (TCS). Specifically, we clarified how self-assessment scores related to competencies in "Professional practice skills" evolved over time, and analyzed the longitudinal trends in self-assessment scores.\n' +
      `METHODS: We included TCS enrolled between 2016 and 2019, and NCS enrolled between 2020 and 2023. Self-assessment of students' competencies in "Professional practice skills," a core component of our institution's competency framework, was conducted by online survey. Competency levels were categorized into Levels A, B, and C.\n` +
      'RESULTS: The self-assessment scores of NCS were significantly higher than those of TCS across most competency domains of "Professional practice skills." The "Medical interview and physical examination" competency revealed that first-year NCS achieved scores equivalent to those of fourth-year TCS. These scores were either maintained or improved as students progressed in years. In the "Clinical skills" competency, NCS outperformed TCS at all levels from the first to the third year, and at Level A in the fourth year. In the "Medical record charting" competency, NCS achieved significantly higher scores than TCS across all levels during the first and second years.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: The early acquisition of clinical skills and exposure to clinical practice enabled students to consistently maintain high self-assessment scores. A curriculum design aligned with OBE appears to foster a heightened sense of self-efficacy among students. This approach is anticipated to facilitate a seamless transition into clinical responsibilities as future physicians.',

    title: 'Tendency to consume alcohol among Poles in the light of coping with stress and selected socio-demographic factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The research aimed to assess the linkages between alcohol propensity and stress and coping styles among Poles during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project also focused on investigating the significance of differences in alcohol propensity, taking into account selected sociodemographic characteristics.\n' +
      'MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1246 people (23.93 ± 2.88 y.o.) participated in the research, including 928 women (23.84 ± 2.89 y.o.) and 318 men (24.21 ± 2.85 y.o.). A self-administered questionnaire, CISS, PSS-10 and AUDIT were used for the study. The statistical procedures used the Pearson correlation coefficient, as well as the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Positive correlations were found between the intensity of stress symptoms and emotional style in female and male groups. Among adults, factors contributed to high-intensity of alcohol propensity included: male gender, childlessness, living in cities of more than 100.000 inhabitants, people with secondary education, lack of a close personal relationship or being in a partnership, as well as a professional situation related to occasional or casual employment.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption is associated with an emotion- and avoidant-oriented stress-coping styles. 39% women and 43% men of the surveyed were among those at risk of developing alcohol addiction. It implies that the age group remains one of the social groups most exposed to the development of alcohol use disorders. Such situation requires development of prevention programmes that take into account the needs of young people.',

    title: "Dentists' role in oral care for head and neck cancer patients in GCC countries.",
    abstract: "This study evaluates dentists' knowledge of oral and dental procedures before and after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer patients in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. A web-based cross-sectional survey was distributed via social media to dentists in six GCC countries, assessing knowledge of pre- and post-radiotherapy oral care. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, and logistic regression. Among 1,223 participants, the highest representation was from Saudi Arabia (n = 387). Overall, 40.1% had poor knowledge, 51.3% moderate, and 8.7% good. Dentists with less than five years of experience demonstrated better knowledge (p < 0.0033). Saudi dentists and those in government clinics had higher knowledge than private practitioners and dentists in other GCC countries. General practitioners outperformed specialists (p < 0.0033). Knowledge of post-radiotherapy care was better than pre-radiotherapy, with significant gaps in management awareness. The findings highlight substantial knowledge deficiencies, particularly in pre-radiotherapy care. Surprisingly, less experienced dentists performed better, likely due to recent education. Despite relatively higher knowledge among Saudi dentists and government employees, overall knowledge remains suboptimal. These findings underscore the need for targeted education and training programs to enhance dentists' understanding of radiotherapy-related oral care.",

    abstract: 'Digital technologies improve health outcomes, access to education and health care. However, their application in the context of climate change is limited. This scoping review aimed to identify the use of digital technologies for climate-related health education, behavior change and health risk reduction in a rapidly changing climate. After screening 20,342 titles, 24 studies published between 2012 and 2025, with 18,749 participants (~54% female), were included in the analysis. Digital technology was used to improve health education (n = 11 studies) health outcomes (n = 9 studies) or health behavior (n = 6 studies). Common climate change topics focused on general climate change (n = 6), heatwaves (n = 4), and earthquakes (n = 3). Commonly used technologies were virtual reality (n = 9), smartphone applications (n = 7) and online platforms (n = 4). While this field is still nascent, there is a clear opportunity to utilize digital technology to reduce the negative health impacts of climate change, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary research and co-designed technologies.',

    title: 'Progress of chronic kidney disease and associated predictors among patients under treatment at Gambi and Felege-Hiwote hospitals.',
    abstract: 'Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a leading cause of mortality, particularly in developing countries. The main objective of current research was to assess the progress and associated factors among CKD patients under treatment at Felege-Hiwot Referral Hospital and Gambi Teaching Hospitals. A study was conducted on a randomly selected 343 CKD outpatients whose follow ups were from September 2017 to January 2021. A longitudinal data were analyzed using logistic regression and Markov Chain techniques. Among the predictors in the current study, rural patients (AOR = 0.698; 95% CI: (0.551, 0.883) and p-value = 0.003), patients with high urinary protein (AOR = 0.771: 95% CI: (0.609,0.976) and p-value = 0.03, patients with high blood urea nitrogen (AOR = 0.961:95%CI: (0.942,0.980) and p-value < 0.01), patients with high hematocrit (AOR = 1.073:95%CI: (1.052,1.094) and p-value < 0.001) and Visiting time of CKD patients (AOR = 1.041: 95% CI: (1.021, 1.061), p-value < 0.001 and the dependence of the parameter (AOR = 1.733:95% CI: (1.345, 1.986) and p-value < 0.001) significantly affected the status of CKD in the study area. Among the potential predictor variables, Blood urea nitrogen, Urinary protein and Lasix had negatively affected the status of CKD patients to be categorized in normal range, whereas, Visiting time and hematocrit positively affected the progress of status of CKD patients to be categorized in normal range. According to the current study, CKD outpatients in rural areas are less likely to have a normal status. More attention should be given those patients living in rural area, patients with high level of blood urea nitrogen and high amount of urinary protein. Health related education should be given to CKD patients to attend closely and adhere the prescribed medication while patients visits the hospitals for treatment and check ups. More attention is also recommended for those CKD with comorbidities.',

    title: 'Predicting academic performance with fuzzy logic in prospective physical education and sports teachers.',
    abstract: "Numerous factors contribute to student success in educational settings, with academic support and learning strategies identified as key influences. Existing research highlights that various academic assistance and individual learning approaches shape student success. Although different methods are available for predicting academic achievement, the application of fuzzy logic in this context remains relatively underexplored. This study seeks to address this gap by employing a fuzzy logic model to forecast the exam performance of prospective physical education and sports teachers. Specifically, the study examines how the learning approaches and perceived levels of academic support among these candidates influence their exam outcomes. The results indicate that fuzzy logic provides a viable tool for predicting student success, demonstrating its potential as an alternative to traditional predictive methods. Furthermore, the findings suggest that students' learning approaches and perceptions of academic support play a significant role in shaping their academic achievements. By integrating fuzzy logic into educational research, this study contributes to a broader understanding of how non-linear and complex interactions between academic support and learning strategies impact student performance. These results highlight the practical potential of fuzzy logic models in identifying at-risk students and designing targeted interventions to improve academic outcomes. Educators and institutions can create more effective and personalised learning environments by fostering deep learning approaches and enhancing academic support systems.",

This study aims to address the lack of theoretical research on improving the height of the basket toss. Structural observations and a video recording were made of the straight ride. Factor analysis, Spearman correlation analysis and the grey correlation analysis method were used to determine the relationship between the height of the basket toss and the specific physical ability of the bases. According to the law of kinematics, to increase the height of the basket toss, the bases and flyer should follow the basic principles of maximizing the dynamics and training to master the stability skills for the basket toss. When using the same flyer and athletes of similar skill levels, coaches can choose bases with a large hand-foot distance and arrange base training in the following order: core strength & stability > explosive upper/lower limb power development.',

    title: 'Evaluating knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and practices regarding vitamin D in pregnant and postnatal Ghanaian women: a cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Vitamin D plays a crucial role in maternal and foetal health during pregnancy and lactation. However, its deficiency remains prevalent among pregnant and post-natal women globally, potentially leading to adverse health outcomes. We assessed and compared the knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and practices regarding vitamin D among pregnant and postnatal women in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana.\n' +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 310 pregnant women and postnatal women from a Municipal Hospital between January to August 2024. A well-structured questionnaire was used to obtain data on demographic, clinical and lifestyle characteristics of participants. Information on awareness, knowledge, attitude and practices regarding vitamin D were also obtained. The binary logistic regression analysis model was used to determine the independent predictors of awareness and knowledge. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Most pregnant women (82%) were aware of vitamin D, compared to postnatal women (71.1%). Pregnant women also showed higher knowledge levels (62% vs. 50.3%). Nearly all postnatal women (100%) and pregnant women (98.1%) had positive attitudes toward vitamin D, with comparable good practices (88.8% for pregnant, 89.9% for postnatal). Having non-formal education [(aOR = 17.639, 95% CI (3.218-96.686), p = 0.001)] or basic education [(aOR = 24.956, 95% CI (6.084-102.366), p < 0.001)] was significantly associated with increased odds of non-awareness. Moreover, having basic education [(aOR = 20.946, 95% CI (6.264-70.042), p < 0.001)] or SHS education [(aOR = 2.725, 95% CI (1.160-6.402), p = 0.021)] were the independent predictors of poor knowledge regarding vitamin D.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Awareness and knowledge of vitamin D were higher among pregnant women compared to postnatal women, with educational level being a significant predictor. Future interventions should prioritize education on the importance of vitamin D, appropriate sun exposure, and dietary sources to mitigate deficiency risks, associated complications, and improve maternal health outcomes during and after pregnancy.',
