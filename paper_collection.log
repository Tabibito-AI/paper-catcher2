    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'Teaching climate complacency: mainstream economics textbooks and the need for transformation in economics education',
    abstract: 'ABSTRACT In this paper we ask, what is mainstream economics education conveying to its students? Standard mainstream economics textbooks treat the environment as a specialist issue in addition to standard concerns and based on solutions that conform to those standard concerns. When viewed as socialisation for students this is a major problem. To illustrate the problems we set out key aspects of the standard format, and draw attention to the structure and contents from two well-known textbooks. Standard textbooks convey the impression that the ‘environmental issue’ is appropriately incorporated and exhibit two complacency-creating features. First, fundamental problems (acute global ecological breakdown, biodiversity loss, climate change crisis etc), issues and urgency cannot be adequately conveyed to students within this way of framing economics. Second, specific theory and policy solutions suggest that the problem is well in hand. We illustrate using the theory of negative externalities.',

    title: 'Strengthening Early Childhood Education in Bangladesh: Lessons from National Education Policy (NEP)-2020 of India',
    summary: 'India and Bangladesh exhibit commonalities in their sociocultural backgrounds and contexts, with both nations facing challenges regarding the education of disadvantaged children. India’s recently introduced National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims to offer universal access to high-quality Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) through an updated educational framework. By contrast, Bangladesh has not yet implemented comparable policies. An evaluation of Bangladesh Early Childhood Education (ECE) situation was undertaken based on the NEP 2020 recommendations. The present study utilised a qualitative methodology and critically analysed relevant policies. This study focuses on pre-primary education programs in rural government primary schools. Data were collected through interviews with Early Childhood Education (ECE) experts and teachers complemented by classroom observations. The results revealed that pre-primary education functioned as a one-year school readiness program for five-year-olds. However, a lack of suitably trained teachers has been noted. The majority of educators had no pre-service training and received only two weeks of on-the-job training. Experts have proposed methods for improving the quality of ECE programs. Bangladesh has encountered difficulties in teacher training, professional development, and contextual implementation. By drawing insights from India’s NEP-2020, this study provides suggestions to enhance Bangladesh’s ECE program.',

    title: 'Micro-credentials in Malaysian higher education: a comprehensive case study approach',
    summary: 'Micro-credentials have become increasingly popular in the modern job market due to the ability to address rapid changes in various industries. These credentials offer flexibility, targeted and tailored learning experiences that fill specific skill gaps while preparing learners for job roles. In the hope of capitalizing on the advantages of this flexible education, higher education institutions in Malaysia are increasingly adopting micro-credentials. Although all micro-credentials offered in Malaysia’s higher education institutes must conform to the Malaysian Qualifications Agency’s standards and regulations, the set-ups and implementation, however, are flexible depending on the institution’s ecosystem. As micro-credentials are relatively new in Malaysia and the references to success stories are usually from overseas universities, which have different settings and environment. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive overview of micro-credentials implementation in the context of Malaysian higher education institutions. This study adopted a qualitative case studies approach on three universities in Malaysia, which represent the public and private universities with different micro-credentials implementation competence. Collation of insights, which includes comparisons on the composition of the working committee, sustainability strategies, and collaboration efforts are documented. An elaborate suggestion for micro-credentials newcomers is also included in this study through a proposed core team composition and detailed implementation pathway. Ultimately, this study contributes to providing potential micro-credentials providers in Malaysia with a reference to micro-credentials best practices.',

    title: 'A Comparative Case Study Investigating Indigenous and Rural Elementary Students’ Conceptions of Community Engineering',
    summary: 'Multiple reform documents call for school-aged children to learn about engineering as a way of developing engineering-literate adults. Children’s attitudes towards and understandings of engineering are influenced by their conceptions of what engineering is. This multiple case study uses photo novellas to investigate primary-grade students’conceptualizations of engineering in their rural or reservation communities. Students from four schools completed similar photo novella assignments where they took pictures of what they considered engineering within their communities and further described those photos in writing or verbally. Photo novellas were analyzed using an a priori codebook to identify themes within and across cases. Every participant across all schools identified tangible engineering artifacts, while fewer students provided examples that represented engineering as systems or processes. Students from reservation schools were more likely to describe the purpose of their engineering examples and describe engineering as “helping.” Students in rural schools were more likely to include descriptions of math and science connections in their engineering examples. Rural students also used possessive language when identifying examples of engineering. This paper provides empirical data for a research-based activity to elicit young students’ ideas of engineering with attention to place-based learning. Findings indicate that photo novellas can be used as a tool for identifying children’s nuanced perspectives of engineering. As the engineering community continues to develop career pathways for students from rural places and Indigenous communities, it is important to recognize the nuanced perspectives different rural and Indigenous populations offer to the field.',

    title: 'Are Digital Tools More Often Implemented in High-Quality Lessons?—Profiles of Instructional Quality and the Use of Digital Tools in Biology and Mathematics Lessons',
    summary: 'The potential contribution of digital tools to quality instruction is a widely debated issue in STEM education. As a first step to investigate this potential, it is necessary to understand how instructional quality and digital tool use are interrelated. Although previous research generally hinted that instructional quality and the use of digital tools are related, it is unclear how these relations are specific to different STEM subjects. Addressing this research gap, we compared the association between instructional quality and the use of digital tools in biology (Study 1) and mathematics lessons (Study 2) based on the questionnaires answered by N  = 2,396 eight-grade students at German secondary schools. On the basis of Latent Profile Analyses of instructional quality features considering both their class-level and their within-class variability, the use of digital tools was compared for the profiles of instructional quality identified for biology and mathematics lessons. Study 1 showed, that the three profiles in biology significantly differed in their use of digital tools, whereas this was not the case with the four profiles identified in mathematics (Study 2). In biology, digital tools had been more often implemented in high-quality than in low-quality lessons. But there was no such difference in mathematics. It was conspicuous that students in biology lessons reported overall more digital tool use than in mathematics. Despite several similarities between STEM subjects, the results suggest that a subject-specific perspective on instructional quality and the use of digital tools is beneficial for a more nuanced approach to teacher training.',

    title: 'Academic ICTs training in South Africa, Cameroon, and Nigeria. Strategies for ICT training course design',
    summary: 'This study examines the effectiveness of ICT training programmes for academics at selected universities in Africa, specifically in Cameroon, Nigeria, and South Africa. Using a qualitative approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five ICT trainers and three trainees to better understand their experiences. The findings highlight both the challenges and the strengths that could be used to improve ICT training and make it more effective and relevant to the participants. Four key themes emerge from our analysis: course objectives and content, teaching strategies, implementation challenges, and expectations/impact of the courses. The objectives of the courses vary considerably—some focus on the practical application of ICT, while others aim to improve the participants’ understanding of ICT systems. Teaching methods also differ, ranging from more traditional teaching approaches to collaborative, project-oriented methods. However, we identify significant challenges, particularly poor internet connectivity and a lack of sufficient technological resources, which affect the learning process. In addition, there is often a divergence between trainer expectations and trainee perceptions of the impact of these courses on their professional development. This study aims to contribute to the definition of strategies to improve the effectiveness of ICT training, in the African context, including Cameroon, Nigeria and South Africa.',

    title: 'Collaborative Dynamics and Psychophysiological Variances in Teaching Methods Measured Through Teacher-Students Compliance: A Cross-Classified Multilevel Analysis',
    summary: 'The present study connects broad educational conceptualizations of teaching method challenges with a detailed and innovative approach to students and teacher collaboration seen in cognitive stress measurements from wearable devices. The approach encompasses variances of collaborative performance in schools through uniquely correlated variables of temporal slopes that highlight the contrast between traditional teaching methods in front and active teaching that emphasize social groups and peer tutoring support. Such contrast may inform collaborative dynamics in education settings, as a stressful environment may serve as a condition that impair student learning and make teachers job more difficult. Each participant was given one wearable for their wrist in naturalistic setting, and a Bayesian cross-classified multilevel model building on posterior distribution between 46 teaching method clusters averaging 832s in length was utilized while accounting for within-level participant stress differences alongside contextual elements. Statistically significant results generally indicate benefits to more traditional teaching methods. Robust estimates were observed where students adapting to the teacher consequently increased their stress levels, emphasizing the importance of letting students actively dictate the mood and rhythm. The presented approach has potential to integrate with further research scaled up for automated contextualized adaptation.',

    title: "An Examination of Factors Affecting Pre-service Science Teachers' Perceived Satisfaction Levels in Distance Education",
    summary: "With the advancement of technology, traditional classroom environments have been increasingly replaced by technology-driven learning settings. This transition has been further accelerated by global crises such as wars, health emergencies, and economic instability, pushing education beyond conventional boundaries. Among these settings, e-learning has significantly enhanced the accessibility and availability of education. This study aimed to examine the relationships between perceived satisfaction, learning outcomes, course structure, course content, instructor role, instructor feedback, and technology quality in e-learning. It also investigated the factors influencing university students' perceived satisfaction in both asynchronous and synchronous e-learning settings. The study involved 247 university students (47 males and 200 females) who participated in a one-year distance education program in science education. After attending synchronous and asynchronous courses for 14 weeks, data was collected. The findings revealed that students did not perceive distance education as more effective than face-to-face instruction. However, with an explained variance of 77%, the proposed model demonstrated that learning outcomes, course structure, course content, instructor role, instructor feedback, and technology quality significantly influenced perceived satisfaction. Among these, learning outcomes, course content, and technology quality had a direct impact. These findings highlight the need for educational institutions to enhance the quality of course content, technology infrastructure, and learning outcomes in e-learning environments to improve student satisfaction and engagement.",

    summary: 'Cognitive learning strategies are seen as a central element for successful learning. Acquiring knowledge about its worth, can support persons in sophisticated groups in attaining academic success. Consequently, the authors are interested in domain-specific learning strategies for mathematics in the academic disciplines of economics and engineering in cooperative tertiary education, in addition to determining gender-specific preferences for particular learning strategies. Data from a cross-sectional design with N  = 565 cooperative students from Germany are used. A 2 × 2 analysis of variance, with one repeated measure, show the impact of academic disciplines and gender on seven specific cognitive learning strategies in mathematics. Taken together, these results show the complexity of cognitive learning strategies in higher education learning.',

    title: 'Development of digital literacy skills of 21st century mathematics teachers and prospective teachers through technology assisted education',
    summary: 'Digital literacy is a 21st century requirement and its importance is increasing day by day. In this article, it was aimed to evaluate the development of digital literacy skills of mathematics teachers and prospective teachers through Technology Assisted Education (TAE). In addition, the opinions of the teachers about the training were also evaluated. The study was conducted within the framework of the TAE. The research was designed in a mixed design, pre-posttest control group true experimental design. The project was carried out with 60 (50 female, 10 male; 20 graduate, 40 undergraduate) students in the experimental group where TAE was applied and 58 students (48 female, 10 male; 15 graduate, 43 undergraduate) in the control group where no intervention was applied. The TAE implementation process lasted 6 days, 4 h each day, for a total of 24 h within the scope of the project program. The project data were collected with the “Digital Literacy (DL) Scale” and a Structured Interview Form (SIF). The quantitative data of the research were analyzed using independent sample t-test, paired wise samples t-test, analysis of covariance and Benferroni test, while the qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. Conclusion of TAE, it was determined that DL’s posttest scores differed significantly between the experimental-control groups. The DL skills of the experimental group, in which instructional activities based on TAE practices were carried out, were found to be higher than the students in the non-intervention control group. As a result, the technology-assisted education and digital literacy content expressed in this study can be integrated into undergraduate mathematics curricula.',

    title: 'A Scoping Review of Assessments in Undergraduate Medical Education: Implications for Residency Programs and Medical Schools',
    summary: 'Objective Assessment at medical schools plays a crucial role by providing feedback, monitoring student promotion, and informing resident selection. Limited research has been conducted to synthesize key features of assessments, and even less is known about how these studies sought validity and reliability evidence. A scoping review was performed to explore key features of assessments and their validity and reliability evidence. Methods Various databases were searched ranging from 2004 to April 2021 following PRISMA guidelines. In-depth reviews of the full text were performed on all selected empirical studies during the extraction phase. Results The final analysis included 218 empirical studies. Various tools were identified, ranging from traditional multiple-choice questions to more contemporary tools incorporating technology and more contextualized workplace-based assessment. Patient care and medical knowledge were the most frequently assessed, primarily using the quantitative methodology. These studies often adopted traditional perspectives in collecting validity evidence based on relations to other variables and internal structure. Many of them used a narrow conceptualization of validity, with some failing to reference validity at all. Conclusions There was no single assessment that could easily differentiate medical students in a standardized, meaningful way. Despite the existence of contemporary validity theories for over two decades, there remains a need for greater education regarding the pivotal role of validity in conducting assessment research. While psychiatry and other residency programs will continue to face challenges in differentiating applicants, these changes present opportunities for medical educators and schools to validate assessments that are highly contextualized to their specific educational environments.',

    title: 'Effectiveness of a community health advisor colorectal cancer screening educational intervention on stool test completion in an African American primary care patient population: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) disparities in incidence and mortality for African Americans compared to white Americans are explained by socioeconomic, behavioral, biological, and cultural factors in addition to lower screening rates and lower stage-specific survival. The behavioral clinical trial, "Test Up Now Education Program" (TUNE-UP) tested a community health advisor (CHA) intervention to increase stool-based screening in African American patients of community health centers (CHC) in Florida.\n' +
      `METHODS: Participants who were not up to date with CRC screening were randomized to two study arms after completing a baseline survey. The two experimental arms were (1) an intervention group which received adapted "Screen to Save" CRC education, a tailored brochure, and CHA education; and (2) a control group which received the brochure only. Participants were surveyed at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome was completion of the stool test within the last year, measured by self-report. The secondary outcomes were CRC knowledge, CRC perceived susceptibility, and CRC screening self-efficacy. For each arm, the proportion of participants who received CRC screening by 12 months was calculated. McNemar's chi-square test was used to test changes in dichotomous outcomes related to CRC screening. For outcome variables measured on a continuous scale, a paired t-test was applied to compare changes in mean values. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models were used to compare effects of the intervention on secondary outcomes, adjusting for covariates and confounding factors.\n` +
      'RESULTS: At 12 months (n = 93), completion of the stool test increased significantly among participants in both study arms, showing no difference; 27 out of 45 (60%) participants in the intervention group and 28 out of 48 (58%) participants in the control group (p = 0.87).The intervention had a significant effect on the two secondary outcomes of CRC knowledge (p = 0.03) and CRC perceived susceptibility (p < 0.001) after adjusting for the covariates and confounders included in the model.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The trial demonstrated CHCs can increase CRC screening among African Americans who were not up to date in receiving recommended screening.\n' +

    title: "Associations between platelet indices and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology in cognitively intact adults: the CABLE study.",
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Although previous studies have shown that specific platelet indices had correlations with cognitive impairment, the associations between platelet indices and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology remain unclear.\n" +
      "METHODS: Our study included 1,047 cognitively normal participants from the Chinese Alzheimer's Biomarker and LifestylE (CABLE) study. The total participants had an average age of 58.33 years, a female proportion of 41.5% and average educational attainment of 9.58 years. Multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the associations of five platelet indices (plateletcrit [PCT], platelet count [PLT], mean platelet volume [MPV], platelet distribution width [PDW], and platelet large cell ratio [PLCR]) with CSF AD biomarkers after adjusting for age, gender, education and APOE ε4 allele status. Furthermore, the interactive, stratified and sensitivity analyses were further conducted to verify their relationships.\n" +
      'RESULTS: In the total participants, we found higher PCT levels were significantly correlated with higher CSF P-tau/Aβ42 (β = 0.102, P = 0.008) and T-tau/Aβ42 (β = 0.102, P = 0.008), as well as lower CSF Aβ42 (β = -0.089, P = 0.018) and Aβ42/Aβ40 (β = -0.093, P = 0.018). Moreover, other four platelet indices (PLT, MPV, PDW, PLCR) demonstrated moderate correlations with CSF AD biomarkers. The interaction analyses revealed that age affected the correlations between PCT and PLT with CSF Aβ42. Importantly, the associations between PCT and the aforementioned CSF AD biomarkers became more significant in the late-life group, but turned non-significant in the mid-life group. Besides, sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our findings.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided preliminary evidence suggesting potential associations between platelet indices (especially PCT) and CSF AD biomarkers in cognitively intact adults. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to further validate these findings.',

    title: 'Effectiveness of interventions designed to increase safe medicine disposal: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Drug-related harm is a major cause of mortality, poisonings, hospitalisations and misuse. Reducing the availability of unused medicines is a component of ensuring medication safety. However, the current literature on how to increase the implementation of medicine disposal strategies needs to be clarified. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of strategies designed to promote medicine disposal.\n' +
      'METHODS: Electronic databases and clinical trial registries were searched from inception to 16th February 2024 without restriction for randomised trials of any interventions aiming to increase medicine disposal compared to any control. Medicine disposal could be done using any method as reported by eligible studies. The primary outcome was the change in the proportion of participants who disposed of unused medicines. Secondary outcomes were changes in patient (e.g. knowledge of disposal strategies), population (e.g. poisonings), environmental (e.g. preventing going to landfill) and economic (e.g. cost-effectiveness) outcomes. The original Cochrane tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on the primary outcome, and a narrative synthesis was performed on secondary outcomes due to heterogeneity. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the quality of evidence. PROSPERO registration: CRD42023491797.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Eighteen randomised trials were included (plus five ongoing, registered trials). All studies were conducted in North America, published from 2016 to 2023, targeted opioid analgesic disposal and included 5347 participants. Interventional strategies of providing disposal kits (risk ratio [RR] 1.42, 95% confidence Interval [CI] 1.13 to 1.79, moderate evidence), education alone (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.09, low evidence), education plus reminder prompts (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.83, moderate evidence) and education plus disposal kits (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.87, moderate evidence) increased disposal compared to routine practice. Secondary outcomes were infrequently reported, including no studies reporting population-level (poisonings, hospitalisations) and environmental outcomes.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate quality of evidence supporting interventions of disposal kits, disposal kit and education and education with text reminders to increase the disposal of unused medicines compared to routine practice. The conclusions of this review should be interpreted following consideration on the quality of evidence and the number of trials conducted.',

    title: 'The association of cardiometabolic multimorbidity with depression and length of hospitalization: a population-based cross-sectional study among adults in Turkey.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Recent developments suggest a strong association between cardiometabolic multimorbidity, depression, and hospitalization. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of cardiometabolic multimorbidity with depression and the length of hospitalization among individuals aged 40 and older.\n' +
      'METHODS: This study is based on the secondary analysis of data obtained from the 2022 Turkey Health Survey conducted by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). A weighted sample of 31,425,252 individuals aged 40 and over was analyzed. The dependent variables of the study are depression and hospitalization, while the independent variable is cardiometabolic multimorbidity. Other covariates include gender, age, education level, physical activity, body mass index, tobacco use, and alcohol use. The weights from the database provided by TUIK were used in the data analysis. The relationship between cardiometabolic multimorbidity and depression was investigated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.\n' +
      'RESULT: Of the included participants, 51.2% were female and 35.5% were between the ages of 40-49. In Model 1, individuals with five cardiometabolic diseases had a 10-fold higher risk of developing depression compared to those with no diseases (OR: 10.0; 95% CI: 9.82-10.23). In Model 2, the risk of depression was 5.1 times higher in individuals with three diseases (OR: 5.1; 95% CI: 5.08-5.14), 5.83 times higher in those with four diseases (OR: 5.3; 95% CI: 5.78-5.88), and 14.6 times higher in individuals with five diseases (OR: 14.6; 95% CI: 14.36-14.99). Furthermore, as the number of cardiometabolic diseases increases, a significant increase in the length of hospitalization was observed (p < 0.001).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study revealed that cardiometabolic multimorbidity may increase the risk of depression and the length of hospitalization in adults. These results may provide guidance for developing disease prevention and control strategies regarding cardiometabolic multimorbidity and associated factors in adults.',

    title: 'Assessing use of eau recommendations in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for chronic pelvic pain syndrome: a case vignette study on dutch pelvic floor physiotherapists practices.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) presents as pain located in the pelvic area lasting for at least six months, often with a multifactorial aetiology. The International Continence Society divides CPPS in multiple domains; one is the musculoskeletal domain. Pelvic floor physiotherapy is a recommended treatment and is advised in the European Association of Urologist (EAU) guidelines. However, in the Netherlands, it is unclear which treatment strategies are used by pelvic floor physiotherapists (PFPs) for CPPS patients due to the lack of a Dutch evidenced-based guideline for physiotherapists. This study provides an overview of the adherence to the EAU guideline by PFPs in managing CPPS patients.\n' +
      'METHODS: A case vignette study using two case vignettes and a general questionnaire defining contextual data. Participants were PFPs treating patients with CPPS in primary care. We contacted 550 qualified PFPs registered in the Dutch national quality registry for physiotherapy.\n' +
      'MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: first, adherence to EAU guidelines and second, the adherence compared to level of education and caseload.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of the invited participants, 198 completed the survey. Of these, 29 (14.6%) scored higher than 80% for both case vignettes; fifty-four (27%) scored 80% for the male case vignette and 30 (15%) scored 80% for the female case.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show low adherence to the EAU guideline's proposed diagnostic and treatment criteria. PFPs should become more familiar with implementation of this guideline.",

    title: 'Assessing anxiety and stress levels in undergraduate nursing students during their clinical placements: a quasi-experimental study.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To analyse the impact of stressors and anxiety on undergraduate nursing students during their clinical placements.\n' +
      "BACKGROUND: Undergraduate nursing students' perceived lack of skills to perform the different activities and techniques required is regarded as one of the most relevant stressors in clinical placements, which thus becomes a challenge in their training. Understanding the sources of stress and how it varies throughout their training makes it possible to plan appropriate intervention and support strategies to equip them with the necessary skills for their future professional careers.\n" +
      'METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study with pre- and post-test measures. 113 third-year undergraduate nursing students carrying out their clinical placements (Practicum I) in two tertiary hospitals in the public health system. In the 2021-2022 academic year, the validated Kezkak questionnaire was administered to assess stressors in clinical placements, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure student anxiety levels.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Ninety-three students participated in the study; 77.66% were female and 21.28% male, with a mean age of 23 ± 6 years. The overall mean score of the Kezkak was significantly reduced when comparing stress at the beginning of clinical practice with the end (2.84 ± 0.45 points vs. 2.53 ± 0.44 points; p < 0.001), with items such as lack of skills (2.98 ± 0.60 vs. 2.71 ± 0.58 points) and uncertainty and powerlessness (3.05 ± 0.50 vs. 2.65 ± 0.53) standing out. Female students reported higher stress levels than male students, and all stress factors analysed decreased after the clinical practice. Similarly, data on anxiety levels obtained from the STAI were reduced at the end of the internship (2.37 ± 0.21 vs. 2.23 ± 0.21; p < 0.001), with a significant decrease in the subsections of state anxiety(2.35 ± 0.22 vs. 2.23 ± 0.22 points; p < 0.001) and trait anxiety (2.40 ± 0.29 vs. 2.25 ± 0.23; p < 0.001).\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the levels of anxiety and perceived stress was evidenced through factors linked to the clinical placements of undergraduate nursing students. The organisational implementation of Practicum I had a positive impact on nursing students. Implementing new teaching strategies prior to the beginning of the practicum, such as the visualization of knowledge pills, could decrease anxiety and stress levels at the beginning and improve students' academic results.",

    title: 'Comparison of salivary statherin and beta-defensin-2 levels, oral health behaviors, and demographic factors in children with and without early childhood caries.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Early childhood caries (ECC) is a widespread pediatric dental condition that is influenced by a combination of biological, behavioral, and demographic factors. Salivary biomarkers, including beta-defensin-2 (BD-2) and statherin (STATH), offer potential as non-invasive tools for detecting and assessing the risk of ECC. This study aims to compare the levels of salivary statherin and beta-defensin-2, alongside oral health behaviors and demographic factors, in children both with and without early childhood caries.\n' +
      'METHODS: This case-control study involved 75 children diagnosed with ECC and 75 age- and gender-matched caries-free controls. Unstimulated saliva samples were obtained and analyzed via ELISA to quantify the levels of beta-defensin-2 and statherin. Demographic and behavioral data were gathered through structured interviews with parents. Statistical analyses included t-tests, logistic regression, and machine learning models to predict the risk of ECC.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Salivary beta-defensin-2 levels were significantly higher in children with ECC (9.25 ± 2.89 ng/mL) compared to caries-free controls (6.41 ± 2.45 ng/mL, p = 0.003), indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker. Statherin levels, although lower in the ECC group, did not differ significantly between groups (p = 0.08). Behavioral factors such as regular dental visits and parental education levels were strongly associated with ECC prevalence. Machine learning models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting ECC, with the Gradient Boosting and CatBoost achieving the highest performance.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Salivary beta-defensin-2 is a promising ECC risk assessment biomarker, while statherin is less effective as an independent predictor. Behavioral and demographic factors significantly influence ECC prevalence. Machine learning models integrating clinical, demographic, and salivary data provide a robust tool for detection and targeted prevention strategies. Comprehensive approaches combining salivary biomarkers and behavioral interventions are critical to managing ECC, particularly in resource-limited settings.',

    title: 'Comparative evaluation of responses from DeepSeek-R1, ChatGPT-o1, ChatGPT-4, and dental GPT chatbots to patient inquiries about dental and maxillofacial prostheses.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence chatbots have the potential to inform and guide patients by providing human-like responses to questions about dental and maxillofacial prostheses. Information regarding the accuracy and qualifications of these responses is limited. This in-silico study aimed to evaluate the accuracy, quality, readability, understandability, and actionability of the responses from DeepSeek-R1, ChatGPT-o1, ChatGPT-4, and Dental GPT chatbots.\n' +
      'METHODS: Four chatbots were queried about 35 of the most frequently asked patient questions about their prostheses. The accuracy, quality, understandability, and actionability of the responses were assessed by two prosthodontists using five-point Likert scale, Global Quality Score, and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printed Materials scales, respectively. Readability was scored using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Flesch Reading Ease. The agreement was assessed using the Cohen Kappa test. Differences between chatbots were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, one-way ANOVA, and post-hoc tests.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Chatbots showed a significant difference in accuracy and readability (p <.05). Dental GPT recorded the highest accuracy score, whereas ChatGPT-4 had the lowest. DeepSeek-R1 performed best, while Dental GPT had the lowest performance in readability. Quality, understandability, actionability, and reader education scores did not show significant differences.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: While accuracy may vary among chatbots, the domain-specific trained AI tool and ChatGPT-o1 demonstrated superior accuracy. Even if accuracy is high, misinformation in health care can have significant consequences. Enhancing the readability of the responses is essential, and chatbots should be chosen accordingly. The accuracy and readability of information from chatbots should be monitored for public health.',

    title: 'The effect of an ISBAR-based clinical supervision model during handover on clinical decision-making and self-efficacy of nursing internship students: a quasi-experimental study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Nursing internship students often lack the necessary clinical decision-making skills, confidence, and experience due to limited competence. To ensure safe and high-quality care, nursing faculty must train graduates with the self-efficacy required to make effective decisions in complex, dynamic, and high-stress healthcare environments. The handover process involves the information that plays a critical role in clinical decision-making and care planning. One of the frameworks used in handover process is ISBAR (Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation). The clinical supervision model serves as an educational and supportive approach aimed at enhancing self-efficacy and skills, including the use of handover.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the impact of an ISBAR-based Clinical Supervision Model (CSM) during handover on clinical decision-making and self-efficacy in nursing internship students.\n' +
      'METHOD: This quasi-experimental, two-group (pre-test and post-test) study was conducted in selected hospitals affiliated with Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, in 2024. Participants were selected through convenience sampling and then randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. Data were collected using the ISBAR communication checklist, the Self-Efficacy in Clinical Performance (SECP) questionnaire, the Clinical Decision-Making questionnaire, and the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale (MCSS). The clinical supervision model and routine supervision were administered over six sessions for the intervention and control groups, respectively. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. Independent t-tests and chi-square tests were used to assess baseline differences between groups. Paired t-tests evaluated within-group changes in clinical self-efficacy and clinical decision-making scores. ANCOVA was applied to compare ISBAR communication scores across six time points and post-intervention clinical self-efficacy and decision-making scores, controlling for pre-intervention values. Repeated measures ANOVA assessed within-group changes in mean ISBAR scores over time, while MANOVA examined multiple, interrelated ISBAR subscale scores. A significance level of p < 0.05 was set for all analyses.\n' +
      'RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the intervention and control groups (p > 0.05). According to the within-group analysis, changes in the ISBAR communication scores over time were significant in both the intervention and control groups (p Time < 0.001), with a greater increase observed in the intervention group (p Intervention < 0.001). The intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement in clinical decision-making (p < 0.001) compared to the control group. Clinical self-efficacy showed significant improvement in both the control and intervention groups after the intervention (P < 0.05). However, between-group analysis showed that the increase was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.001).) The mean score of the Manchester questionnaire in the intervention group in this study was 130.30, reflecting the high impact of implementing the clinical supervision model.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The findings revealed that the use of the clinical supervision model based on the ISBAR framework led to improvements in clinical self-efficacy and clinical decision-making, alongside the enhancement of handover skills in nursing internship students. Therefore, it is recommended that this model be utilized in the education of nursing students and newly graduated nurses to ensure safe and high-quality care.',
