    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +

      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +

      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +

    title: 'The Effectiveness of 3D Virtual Environments for BPMN Teaching: A Quasi-Experimental Study',
    summary: 'Traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, being static and highly abstract, often hinder comprehension, particularly for novice designers and students. This can lead to misinterpretations and process inefficiencies. In this study, we investigate whether immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments can enhance the understanding of BPMN models. We developed a virtual reality (VR)-based BPMN visualization tool and conducted a quasi -experiment with 48 academic and professional participants, who interacted with a 3D BPMN model using Google Cardboard and a joystick. Participants completed comprehension tasks before and after the VR experience. The results show significant improvements in understanding and engagement, suggesting that immersive virtual reality can be a valuable educational tool for BPMN learning. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the integration of 3D environments in process modeling education, offering benefits for both academic and professional training.',

    title: 'Assessing the role of artificial intelligence in quality of legal education with special reference to sustainable development goal',
    summary: 'The transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly apparent in a variety of fields, including legal education. This study investigates the potential of AI in transforming legal education in order to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), 2030. As nations and cultures global struggle to achieve the SDGs, legal professionals play an important role in establishing legal frameworks that support progress toward these goals. It can improve the delivery of legal curricula by providing customized learning experiences targeted to individuals. AI can also help educators to create current content and enhance the evaluation. Education is now more dynamic, accessible, and affordable, expanding its reach. Quality of legal education is a cornerstone of achieving the SDGs set for 2030. The effective utilization of AI in the field of legal education holds significant promise in not only expanding access but also improving the quality of legal education. AI-powered legal research tools have the potential to revolutionize legal research for law students, researchers, and legal practitioners. They can provide more efficient and comprehensive ways to explore legal precedents, case law, and statutes, thus empowering legal professionals to perform their duties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By improving access to legal information, these tools can play a significant role in the formulation of laws and regulations that align with the SDGs. This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which AI can contribute to advancing legal education and, consequently, supporting the attainment of the SDGs.',

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems.

    summary: 'This report details a set of three tasks used in an exploratory study of pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) experiences of task design for the mathematics classroom. The three tasks, which I call the Orange Dot Tasks , were constructed in Desmos, a dynamic geometry environment (DGE), and participants engaged each task through manipulating draggable objects on iPad touchscreens. The purpose of this report is two-fold: one aim is to present the tasks in detail and to elaborate on the intentions behind their design and a second is to present some perspectives of PSTs on these tasks generated through their participation in the study.',

    title: 'Making Tens with Four Hands: Touchscreen-Based Classroom Activity for Early Number Learning',
    summary: 'As schools increasingly embrace embodied learning, there is a growing need to incorporate classroom teaching and learning activities that recognize the body’s role as both an individual and collective resource for cognition and instruction. In response, we present a design for a classroom teaching sequence focused on early number learning, featuring pedagogical activities supported by TouchCounts (TC) and engaged by pairs of children using their four hands. These activities showcase the potential of embodied learning for children to explore concepts such as odd and even numbers, as well as the composition and decomposition of numbers up to and including ten. We elaborate on the functionalities of TC, outline the teaching sequence, and offer episodes of our classroom observations. Specifically, we present three lesson snapshots aimed at first-graders (aged 6 to 7) using a class set of TC, student learning outcomes, and notable observations as students interact with the touchscreen environment. For example, we note that the student pairs used their hands to reinforce, extend, and redirect mathematical ideas; besides, they developed a collective discourse through (gestural) subitizing the number of fingers that they (and their partner) put up (and folded down). This snapshot explicates the collective learning experiences in classroom settings involving pair-work activities and informs existing work on embodied (mathematical) cognition beyond how students learn with their bodies individually.',

    summary: 'In this article, we investigate the effects of the app Fingu on a child’s understanding of the part-whole concept. Using the Artifact Centric Activity Theory framework, we initially analyse the internalisation and externalisation processes that appear to occur during one child’s use of the app. Based on the learning from this process, we then use other aspects of the framework, in particular the subject-artifact-group triangle, to understand how Fingu might be used productively in mathematics education classrooms. Using a 13-min video of a child playing Fingu as our data source, we analyse how children might, as they learn about part-whole relationships, interact with the game. We also investigate how design principles in creating apps can impact on the experience of using the app in ways that may be unintended by their designers. This work has implications for app designers and for mathematics educators seeking to incorporate digital technologies into mathematics education.',

    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: 'Investigation and analysis of influencing factors on the economic burden of varicella disease in Qingyang, China, 2024.',
    abstract: 'This study aims to evaluate the economic burden and associated determinants of varicella cases in Qingyang City, Gansu Province, thereby informing the formulation and effectiveness evaluation of varicella prevention and control strategies. Based on socioeconomic and geographic characteristics, varicella cases reported in 2024 from Xifeng District, Heshui County, and Zhenyuan County were selected for cross-sectional surveys. The direct and indirect economic burdens were analyzed using Excel 2010 and SPSS 20.0 software. Univariate analysis (Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis tests) was conducted to identify factors associated with economic burden, subsequently, binary Logistic regression was employed for multivariate analysis of significant variables. A total of 1,010 varicella cases were analyzed. Clinical characteristics revealed a mean disease duration of 10.33 ± 2.45 days and work loss time of 9.45 ± 4.38 days. Healthcare utilization included an average of 1.80 ± 1.15 medical visits and caregiver duration of 9.37 ± 2.46 days. The overall economic burden amounted to $283,428 (US), resulting in a per capita burden of $256 (IQR: $212-$345). Per capita total economic burdens for mild, moderate-severe, and hospitalized varicella cases were calculated as $172, $257 and $487, respectively (χ = 205.730,  < .001); for cases with 0-dose, 1-dose and 2-dose varicella vaccination histories was $286, $172 and $180, respectively(χ = 45.507,  < .001); urban versus rural case burden were identified as $277 and $287, respectively (Z = -2.316,  < .05), indicating statistically significant differences across these data sets. The direct economic burden was $95,590, and the indirect economic burden was $187,837. Factors influencing the economic burden included fever severity, the number of rashes, case type, residence type, presence of complications, and varicella vaccination history. Varicella imposes a considerable economic burden in Qingyang, with significant variations associated with vaccination status. The low coverage of varicella vaccination underscores the urgent necessity to implement targeted vaccination strategies and enhance public health education aimed at reducing disease-related costs.',

    title: 'Applications and Future Perspectives of Large Language Models in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery: A Comprehensive Survey.',
    abstract: 'Since the release of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have rapidly expanded into professional domains, including the medical field. These models, trained on vast text corpora, including the medical literature, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in tasks such as clinical decision support, research assistance, and education. This review focuses on the applications of LLMs in otolaryngology and head and neck surgery (ENT). We analyzed 25 studies published between January 2022 and March 2025 in ENT journals ranked in the top 25% based on the 2023 edition of the Journal Citation Reports (Q1). Moreover, we categorized them by use case and examined the models, datasets, and evaluation methods employed. Despite the growing adoption of LLMs in the ENT field, several challenges remain, including limited model diversity, inconsistent evaluations, and insufficient accuracy and fairness. We also contextualized LLM research trends within a broader medical domain. We highlighted five key areas for advancing clinical-grade LLMs: robust evaluation frameworks, external source-based generation, multimodal integration, agent-based reasoning, and model explainability. Our findings provide ENT clinicians and researchers with a practical foundation for understanding, evaluating, and applying LLMs or advanced versions of LLMs (e.g., Large Multimodal Models, Agents) in clinical and research settings.',

    title: "The decision-making process in the choice of VBAC: Facilitators and barriers from women's perception, a systematic review.",
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is associated with a lower risk of maternal morbidity, fewer complications in future pregnancies, and a reduced overall cesarean section (C-section) rate at the population level. Despite these benefits, a woman's decision for VBAC is shaped by multiple factors. This review aims to identify elements perceived by women as influential in the VBAC decision-making process.\n" +
      'METHODS: We conducted a systematic review between 1 June and 12 July 2024, using PubMed, CINAHL, Embase and PsycINFO. We included English-language studies (2014-2024) on women eligible for VBAC with ≥1 previous C-sections. Study quality was appraised using CASP. Findings were narratively and thematically synthesized.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen recurring factors were identified. 'Facilitators' of VBAC included: mother-newborn bonding; support from partner and family; desire for vaginal birth; previous VBAC experience; shorter postpartum recovery; partner and family support; social support from other women; healthcare professionals' attitudes; communication and respectful maternity care; and counseling. 'Barriers' included: anxiety and fear of the unknown; healthcare professional's misinformation and attitudes; coercive counseling; pain related to labor; loss of control; and perceived risk to mother or newborn.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: VBAC decision-making is influenced by past birth experiences, perceived support, and current concerns. Healthcare professionals' attitudes and high-quality counseling are key to informed, unbiased choices. Continuity of care, midwifery care and education can empower women and reduce unnecessary C-sections. However, as most studies are from high-income, English-speaking countries, findings may not generalize globally.",

    title: 'Monetising misfortune: the financial consequences of injuries in professional football teams.',
    abstract: "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the financial impact of player injuries on team performance in German football's first and second divisions, focusing on the indirect costs related to reduced performance and lost revenue.\n" +
      'METHOD: This retrospective, longitudinal study analysed data from seven seasons (2014/2015 to 2020/2021) of the Bundesliga. Injury metrics (incidence, burden and matchday unavailability) were examined using linear mixed models to assess their relationship with team performance (league rank and points). Financial impacts were estimated by translating performance declines into revenue losses from TV broadcasting rights and prize money.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Findings show a significant negative relationship between most injury measures and team performance across both divisions. In the second division, an additional 333 injury days were associated with a one-rank drop, while the relationship was not statistically significant in the first division. For injury incidence, an increase of 4.33 injured players in the first division and 2.64 injured players in the second division corresponded to a one-rank drop. Matchday unavailability had similarly strong effects: in the first division, an additional 1.62 unavailable players per matchday were linked to a one-rank drop, while in the second division, only 0.71 unavailable players resulted in the same outcome. Financial losses due to injury-related performance declines were substantial, particularly for higher-ranked teams in the first division.\n' +

    title: 'Impact of the Composite Allocation Score on Lung Transplant Waitlist and Posttransplant Outcomes.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: On March 9, 2023, the Composite Allocation Score (CAS) was introduced for all lung transplantation (LT) candidates. We analyzed waitlist and posttransplant outcomes after CAS implementation.\n' +
      'METHODS: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing registry (2022-2024), adult patients listed for isolated LT were divided into 2 eras: era 1 (pre-CAS: March 1, 2022-March 8, 2023) and era 2 (post-CAS: March 9, 2023-September 30, 2024). Competing risk regression analyzed waitlist events. Recipient/donor characteristics and mortality risk factors were assessed with Cox models. Survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among 6398 LTs, 2598 (40.6%) occurred in era 2. More Black patients (16.9% versus 15%,  = 0.04) and those with a high school education (35.4% versus 33.4%,  = 0.0003) were transplanted. ABO type O patients were less likely to undergo LT (42.5% versus 46.6%,  = 0.04). Era 2 had longer transport distances (231 versus 202 miles,  < 0.0001), ischemic times (5.1 versus 4.9 h,  < 0.0001), and increased use of flights (79.1% versus 72.8%,  < 0.0001). Donation after circulatory death (9.4% versus 6.2%,  < 0.0001) and normothermic regional perfusion (2.2% versus 1.2%,  = 0.02) usage rose. Waitlist times decreased (29 versus 31 d,  = 0.009), with improved outcomes (sub-hazard ratio, 0.70;  < 0.0001). Era 2 showed superior 6-mo and 1-y survival ( < 0.0001) and reduced rejection treatment (2.6% versus 14.5%,  < 0.0001).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of CAS was associated with reduced waitlist mortality, improved access for marginalized groups, and enhanced survival. Lungs were procured from greater distances with an increased use of donation after circulatory death with normothermic regional perfusion or ex vivo perfusion. Disparities remain for ABO type O patients, warranting closer follow-up.',

    title: 'Outcomes of High Kidney Donor Profile Index Hepatitis C Nucleic Acid Testing Positive Kidneys are Equivalent to Matched Hepatitis C Nucleic Acid Testing Negative Kidneys.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: A recent Organ Procurement and Transplant Network policy change removes hepatitis C virus (HCV) status and race from the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) calculation, thereby lowering the KDPI of HCV nucleic acid testing positive (NAT) kidneys and increasing their allocation priority. However, even in the era of direct-acting antivirals, high KDPI HCV NAT kidneys exhibited higher discard rates compared with their HCV NAT counterparts, and outcome data for this "high-risk" group remain limited. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by providing comprehensive outcome data to better inform organ allocation and selection decisions under the new KDPI framework.\n' +
      'METHODS: Using national transplant data from 2015 to 2023, we analyzed adult deceased donor kidney transplants stratified by KDPI and HCV NAT status. An exact matching model was used to identify the matched HCV NAT group.\n' +
      'RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in delayed graft function, rejection, or patient and graft survival between high KDPI HCV NAT and matched HCV NAT recipients. High KDPI HCV NAT kidneys were more often allocated regionally or nationally, with 67.6% occurring in 4 regions. Their recipients were more likely to have a high school education and shorter wait times. After the policy change, >90% of prior high KDPI HCV NAT kidneys will no longer be classified as high KDPI.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the safe utilization of previously high KDPI HCV NAT kidneys after a policy change. Although the revised KDPI may assist clinicians in identifying higher-quality organs, its impact on existing sociodemographic disparities and overall organ utilization rate remains uncertain.',

    abstract: " The integration of research into nursing practice is fundamental for advancing evidence-based healthcare. This study examines the factors influencing Saudi nursing students' attitudes toward evidence-based research.  A cross-sectional survey was conducted among nursing students in Saudi Arabia from September 2023 to January 2024. Data were collected via an online questionnaire, which included demographic details and the attitudes toward research (ATR) scale. Statistical analyses employed descriptive and inferential statistics.  Of the 603 participants, 56.72% were male, predominantly aged 21-25 years (65.67%), and 76.12% attended public institutions. Most were pursuing a B.Sc. in nursing (85.07%). The overall mean score of the ATR scale was 3.13 ± 0.51 out of 5, indicating a moderately positive attitude level among the students. A significant negative correlation was found between research usefulness and research anxiety ( = -0.4,  < 0.001), and a strong positive correlation existed between research usefulness and positive ATR ( = 0.73,  < 0.001). Research anxiety was negatively correlated with positive ATR ( = -0.49,  < 0.001). Additionally, research difficulty was significantly correlated with both research anxiety ( = 0.78,  < 0.001) and positive ATR ( = -0.48,  < 0.001). Notably, a statistically significant association was observed between the type of institute and the overall mean score, with students from public institutes scoring higher than those from private institutes. Linear regression analysis further confirmed that the type of institute was a significant predictor of overall ATR.  The study revealed a moderately positive attitude among students toward the utility of evidence-based research in their profession while highlighting concerns in areas such as research anxiety and difficulty. Compared with their private institute counterparts, students from public institutes displayed more favorable attitudes, indicating a need for educational policymakers to address disparities in research education. Addressing research anxiety and perceived difficulty through curriculum design and teaching methods could foster more positive ATR among nursing students, contributing to the advancement of evidence-based practices in nursing care.",

Median BOCS scores increased significantly from 60.0 (54.0-64.0) to 75.0 (72.0-81.0; p<0.001), with notable improvements in emergency response (2.00→3.50) and operational skills (2.75→3.50). Modified OBAT scores rose from 66.7 (60.7-74.4) to 79.7 (76.7-84.9; p<0.001), notably, there were significant improvements in the scores for operational skills, diagnostic abilities, and post-procedure management.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: Remote visualized teaching significantly enhances trainees' confidence and clinical competence, serving as a valuable adjunct to traditional bronchoscopy education.",
