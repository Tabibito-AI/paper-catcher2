    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. â€¦`,

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPTâ€™s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPTâ€™s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Studentsâ€™ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop studentsâ€™ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the studentsâ€™ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in studentsâ€™ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the studentsâ€™ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score â€“ A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) â€“ An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies â€“ The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) â€“ The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) â€“ A year of life lived in perfect health.

Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    abstract: 'ABSTRACT In this paper we ask, what is mainstream economics education conveying to its students? Standard mainstream economics textbooks treat the environment as a specialist issue in addition to standard concerns and based on solutions that conform to those standard concerns. When viewed as socialisation for students this is a major problem. To illustrate the problems we set out key aspects of the standard format, and draw attention to the structure and contents from two well-known textbooks. Standard textbooks convey the impression that the â€˜environmental issueâ€™ is appropriately incorporated and exhibit two complacency-creating features. First, fundamental problems (acute global ecological breakdown, biodiversity loss, climate change crisis etc), issues and urgency cannot be adequately conveyed to students within this way of framing economics. Second, specific theory and policy solutions suggest that the problem is well in hand. We illustrate using the theory of negative externalities.',

    summary: 'Abstract Watkinsâ€™,Â  Harvard Educational Review, 63 (3), 321â€“339Â ( 1993 ) Black curriculum orientations challenge us to explore educationâ€”why we teach, what we teachâ€”in its sociopolitical context, the way it is politically brokered and negotiated, the political ideology to which it tends, the ways it curates our identities, and is responsive to our lived experiences. This study revisits Watkinâ€™s ( 1993 ) conceptualizations of Black curriculum orientations and draws from literature that (1) nuances and complicates these conversations and contentious debates, (2) situates and contextualizes these conversations within the sociopolitical realities of the Black community, and (3) includes and amplifies the voices of HBCU administrators, faculty, and students whose curricular contributions have been historically silenced. To distill the extant literature on Black curriculum orientations, this study surveys peer-reviewed journal articles, scholarly books, memoirs, and archival data that captures conversations from faculty, administrators, and students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) about the purpose, meaning, and value of education.Â ',

    title: 'Navigating racism: A scoping review of barriers in the experiences of Black Health Professions students',
    summary: "This manuscript examines the racism experienced by Black students in health professions through a scoping review of 33 articles. The analysis reveals significant gaps in the literature across multiple dimensions of racism, including interpersonal, community, institutional and systemic levels. Interpersonal racism, identified in 30% of the studies, demonstrates how discriminatory interactions negatively affect students' academic performance and overall well-being. Community racism, addressed in 24% of the studies, highlights the role of community norms in fostering exclusion and stereotype threat. Institutional racism was minimally addressed, appearing in only 3% of the studies, and focusing primarily on barriers posed by standardized testing. Systemic racism and historical factors received limited attention, with 52% of the studies failing to adequately connect these broader forces to the racialized experiences of Black students. Addressing these gaps is essential for shaping policies that dismantle structural barriers, promote equitable admissions, and expand funding for initiatives that support Black students pursuing health professions. Prioritizing these efforts is critical to creating a more inclusive educational environment, improving student outcomes, and reducing health disparities.",

    title: 'More than movement: a systematic review of moral and social development in adolescents physical education',
    summary: 'Background This paper investigates the dimensions of moral and social development within physical education (PE) programs for adolescents, examining theoretical foundations, empirical evidence, and practical implementations. The review highlights the role of PE in fostering moral and social development and explores how cultural contexts may influence research and practice. By integrating these dimensions, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of how PE contributes to adolescent development while accounting for cultural variability. Methods A systematic review was conducted using Web of Science, EBSCO, and Scopus databases. The final search was performed in July 2024. A total of 3,114 non-duplicate articles were identified. After screening titles, abstracts, and full texts, 44 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were assessed based on methodologies, program structures, findings, and alignment with cultural values. Results The review indicates that PE programs integrating moral education contribute to the development of studentsâ€™ moral and social competencies. Programs appeared to be designed that align with prevailing cultural values and traditions, which may enhance their perceived relevance and acceptance. However, due to the methodological diversity of included studies, direct comparisons across studies were limited. Conclusions The findings suggest that PE-based programs promoting moral and social development are generally effective. Further research, including meta-analyses, is recommended to compare different program approaches systematically. Future studies should also aim to standardize evaluation methods to improve comparability and explicitly consider cultural context as an important factor influencing program design and outcomes.',

    title: 'Strengthening the Kindergarten Teacherâ€™s Manual Based on the NCTM Standards: Proposed Amendments',
    summary: 'There is a prominent and steadily growing interest in mathematics learning in early childhood education. Teaching mathematics is dependent not only on the teachersâ€™ competencies and characteristics but also on the quality of the curricular resources they use, including manuals. In the Palestinian education system, the kindergarten teacherâ€™s manual is the sole official written curriculum resource available for kindergarten education. The purpose of this study is to analyze and strengthen the kindergarten teacherâ€™s manual based on theÂ Standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics by proposing developmental amendments to it. To achieve this purpose, two methods were used: quantitative content analysis of the Kindergarten Teacherâ€™s Manual based on the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Standards and qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with Palestinian early childhood professionals. The results showed that although the Manual was a strong first-draft document; the mathematics content is incomplete, as it does not include all the standardsâ€™ expectations for kindergarten; and the sequencing is not logically aligned with childrenâ€™s developmental progression. This study proposes amendments which are emphasizing early childhood development; re-arranging the Manual to reflect a logical sequence of mathematical skills; adding the complete mathematics content; and a restructuring of the activities themselves. The intended amended manual will have clear and compelling implications in the field and will empower kindergarten teachers to become more confident in teaching and developing the early childhood curriculum in the Palestinian education system. Lâ€™apprentissage des mathÃ©matiques dans lâ€™Ã©ducation de la petite enfance suscite un intÃ©rÃªt croissant. Lâ€™enseignement des mathÃ©matiques dÃ©pend non seulement des compÃ©tences et des caractÃ©ristiques des enseignants, mais aussi de la qualitÃ© des ressources pÃ©dagogiques utilisÃ©es, y compris les manuels. Dans le systÃ¨me Ã©ducatif palestinien, le manuel de lâ€™enseignant de maternelle reprÃ©sente la seule ressource pÃ©dagogique officielle Ã©crite disponible pour lâ€™enseignement de la maternelle. Lâ€™objectif de cette Ã©tude est dâ€™analyser et de renforcer le manuel de lâ€™enseignant de maternelle sur la base des normes du Â«Â Conseil national des enseignants de mathÃ©matiquesÂ» (NCTM, en anglais) en y proposant des modifications en matiÃ¨re de dÃ©veloppement. Pour atteindre ce but, nous avons utilisÃ© deux mÃ©thodes: une analyse quantitative du contenu du manuel de lâ€™enseignant de maternelle en nous appuyant sur les normes du Â«Â Conseil national des enseignants de mathÃ©matiquesÂ» et une analyse qualitative fondÃ©e sur des entrevues semi-structurÃ©es avec des professionnels palestiniens de la petite enfance. Les rÃ©sultats ont montrÃ© que, bien que le manuel constitue un document initial de qualitÃ©, son contenu en mathÃ©matiques est incomplet, car il nâ€™inclut pas toutes les attentes normatives pour la maternelle, et son enchaÃ®nement nâ€™est pas alignÃ© de maniÃ¨re logique sur la progression du dÃ©veloppement de lâ€™enfant. Dans cette Ã©tude, nous proposons les amendements suivants: mettre lâ€™accent sur le dÃ©veloppement de la petite enfance, rÃ©organiser le manuel pour offrir une sÃ©quence logique de compÃ©tences mathÃ©matiques, ajouter la totalitÃ© du contenu mathÃ©matique et restructurer les activitÃ©s elles-mÃªmes. Une fois modifiÃ©, le manuel attendu aura des implications claires et convaincantes sur le terrain et permettra aux enseignants de maternelle dâ€™Ãªtre plus confiants dans lâ€™enseignement et le dÃ©veloppement du programme destinÃ© Ã  la petite enfance dans le systÃ¨me Ã©ducatif palestinien.',

    title: 'An evaluation of programmatic assessment across health professions education using contribution analysis',
    summary: 'Programmatic assessment is gaining traction in health professions education. Despite this popularity, educators continue to grapple with complex contextual factors that impact implementation and outcome attainment. We used contribution analysis, a theory-informed evaluation method, to understand the mechanisms underpinning successful implementation. Applying the six steps of contribution analysis, we developed a postulated theory of change (ToC) and then conducted a qualitative study with programmatic assessment stakeholders (graduates nâ€‰=â€‰15, supervisors nâ€‰=â€‰32, faculty nâ€‰=â€‰19) from four Australian dietetic programs. These data were analysed using the Framework Analysis method and integrated with data derived from a literature review across health disciplines, to assemble contribution claims and the story, and verify the ToC. Impact pathways for programmatic assessment from inception to implementation, and contribution to outcomes were articulated in the ToC. Leaders drove implementation using compromise and worked with a design team to apply the versatile principles. All people required training, and purposefully designed tools were implemented within an ideologically aligned system. Re-orientation of responsibilities situated learners as leaders, contributing to a psychologically safe environment which promoted growth mindsets. Credible high-stakes progression decisions were enabled, people experienced less stress, and derived gratification from assessment. External factors (institutional and accreditation requirements) and threats (resource mismatches, ideological misalignments, and capabilities of the people) were identified. Contribution analysis revealed mechanisms that educators can apply to implement a contextually responsive programmatic assessment across diverse settings.',

    title: 'The role of textbooks in the implementation of curriculum development: a comparative study through the lens of Chinese and Indonesian teachersâ€™ views',
    summary: 'Textbooks are an essential source for the implementation of new curriculum in many countries. However, the role of textbooks in the process is not a fixed entity, as it is shaped by individual teachersâ€™ practices. This study aims to investigate, through the lens of teachersâ€™ views, what role textbooks play in the implementation of curriculum development in two educational settings, Shanghai, China and Central Java, Indonesia. Using a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and interviews, to collect data from 84 mathematics teachers in both countries, the study examined the interplay between curriculum development with a focus on three dimensions - teaching strategies, content, and assessment - and the role of textbooks in its implementation. The results showed that overall textbooks play an important role in the implementation of curriculum development in both Chinese and Indonesian educational settings, but differences were also found about the role of textbooks in different dimensions of the implementation; while Chinese teachers view the content of teaching, Indonesian teachers chose teaching strategies as the most important aspects of textbooks in implementing new curriculum, and the differences are related to the fact that curriculum reform in each country has different characteristics, and in particular, Indonesian teachers are more encouraged to construct their content according to the needs of their students, allowing for differentiated learning, which contributes to the discretionary use of textbooks by both teachers and students. The paper argues that these characteristics should be supported by textbooks that are aligned with curriculum reform in different educational settings.',

    title: 'Studentsâ€™ acceptance and use of generative AI in pharmacy education: international cross-sectional survey based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology',
    summary: 'Background Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has significant potential implications for pharmacy education, but its ethical, practical, and pedagogical implications have not been fully explored. Aim This international study evaluated pharmacy studentsâ€™ acceptance and use of GenAI tools using the Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Method A cross-sectional survey of pharmacy students from nine countries during the first half of 2024 assessed GenAI usage patterns, curricular integration, and acceptance via the Extended UTAUT framework. After appropriate translation and cultural adaptation, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified key adoption factors. Results A total of 2009 responses were received. ChatGPT and Quillbot were the tools most frequently utilised. EFA identified three key dimensions: Utility-Driven Adoption, Affordability and Habitual Integration, and Social Influence. Students rated performance and effort expectancy highly, highlighting their perceived usefulness and ease of use of GenAI tools. In contrast, habit and price value received lower ratings, indicating barriers to habitual use and affordability concerns. Gender disparities were noted, with males demonstrating significantly higher acceptance ( p â€‰<â€‰0.001). Additionally, country-specific differences were evident, as Malaysia reported a high performance expectancy, while Egypt exhibited low facilitating conditions. Over 20% indicated an over-reliance on GenAI for assignments, raising ethical concerns. Significant gaps were observed, such as limited ethical awarenessâ€”only 10% prioritised legal and ethical trainingâ€”and uneven curricular integration, with 60% reporting no formal exposure to Generative AI. Conclusion Findings reveal critical gaps in ethical guidance, equitable access, and structured GenAI integration in pharmacy education. A proactive, context-specific strategy is essential to align technological innovation with pedagogical integrity.',

    summary: 'Translation education is essential for global communication but remains under-researched. This study revisits Ajzenâ€™s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explore how studentsâ€™ beliefs influence their engagement in translation programs using a new model. A new TPB questionnaire was developed and validated using a Reflective-Reflective Higher-Order Construct (R-R HOC) model. Data were collected from 45 undergraduate and graduate students across ten Saudi universities. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to assess both measurement and structural models. Bootstrapping with 5,000 subsamples supported the statistical significance of all path relationships. The results confirmed strong reliability and validity for the four TPB constructsâ€”intention, attitude toward behavior (AB), subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC). These constructs collectively predicted studentsâ€™ planned behavior beliefs. No significant differences were found by gender or education level, suggesting similar beliefs across groups. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses highlighted studentsâ€™ calls for practical training, specialized courses, and better integration of technology in translation programs. This study demonstrates the value of combining social psychology with translation education and offers a validated model for future research. It encourages curriculum designers and policymakers to consider psychological constructs when shaping translation education programs.',

    title: 'Music Education for Autistic Children with Intellectual Disability: Parental Attitudes and Support',
    summary: 'This study aimed to investigate differences in parental attitudes toward music and support for music education between typically developing children and autistic children with mild or borderline intellectual disability (ID) in Hong Kong. While research highlights the developmental benefits of music for autistic children with ID, few studies explore formal music training in this population, particularly within the context of cultural influences. The study included 148 participants, consisting of 84 parents of typically developing children and 64 parents of autistic children with ID. A questionnaire was used to assess parental attitudes toward music and their decisions regarding formal music training enrollment for their children. Covariates such as family income, child executive function, and parental expectations were analyzed to identify potential predictors. Parents of autistic children with ID held more positive attitudes toward music compared to parents of typically developing children when controlling for covariates. However, only 14.1% of autistic children with ID were enrolled in formal music training, in contrast to 40.4% of typically developing children. Family income and child executive function emerged as significant barriers to enrollment decisions. The findings highlight a disparity between positive parental attitudes toward music and pursuit of music education among autistic children with ID, highlighting systemic and financial barriers. Accessible music programs, adjustments in parental expectations, and inclusive policies may bridge the gap between parental attitudes and actual support. These insights call for targeted interventions to ensure that autistic children with ID can access the developmental benefits of music education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Neurocognitive Health via Activity, Nutrition and Cognitive Exercise (ENHANCE): A Randomized Controlled Trial.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: While multidomain interventions show promise for promoting healthy aging, their impact on brain structure remains unclear. This randomized controlled trial (ENHANCE) assessed the efficacy of a 12-month group-based multidomain intervention on brain structure and function in community-dwelling older adults, with particular attention to urban-rural disparities.\n' +
      'METHODS: The ENHANCE trial delivered twice-weekly group-based multidomain sessions (physical exercise, cognitive training and nutrition education) in urban and rural communities for 12â€‰months, while the control group received quarterly telephone education. A total of 88 participants completed the trial (attendance rates >â€‰60% across all sites), with 76 completing longitudinal MRI assessments (intervention: nâ€‰=â€‰35; control: nâ€‰=â€‰41). The intervention group (nâ€‰=â€‰44; 75.0% female) was significantly older than the control group (nâ€‰=â€‰44; 70.5% female) (75.0â€‰Â±â€‰6.6 vs. 72.3â€‰Â±â€‰5.0â€‰years, pâ€‰=â€‰0.035) and had lower BMI (23.4 vs. 25.2â€‰kg/m, pâ€‰=â€‰0.016) at baseline. The primary outcomes were brain structures (voxel-based changes in brain grey matter volume [GMV]), while secondary outcomes were functional outcomes (physical performance, nutritional status, cognitive function, psychosocial assessments and cardiometabolic biomarkers).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Using two-stage tensor-based morphometry analysis, the intervention group demonstrated significantly less GMV reduction in regions over the left inferior temporal lobe compared with controls over 12â€‰months (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Using generalized estimating equation (GEE) model, the intervention group showed enhanced physical performance at 6â€‰months (5-time chair rise test: -1.19â€‰s; 95% CI, -2.24 to -0.13; pâ€‰=â€‰0.028) and improved cognitive function by 12â€‰months (Montreal Cognitive Assessment: +1.32 points; 95% CI, 0.10-2.54; pâ€‰=â€‰0.034). Cardiometabolic improvements included increased HDL-C (+6.65â€‰mg/dL, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) and decreased triglycerides (-16.07â€‰mg/dL, pâ€‰=â€‰0.025) at 12â€‰months in GEE models. In subgroup analyses, rural participants showed preserved GMV in additional regions including the cerebellum (Crus I and II) and occipital cortex with greater cognitive improvements (MoCA: +3.06 points; 95% CI, 0.84-5.27; pâ€‰=â€‰0.007), while urban participants showed greater GMV reduction in the left temporal-occipital fusiform cortex but achieved superior physical performance gains (5-time chair rise test: -1.85â€‰s; 95% CI, -3.07 to -0.64; pâ€‰=â€‰0.003).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that multidomain interventions can induce neuroplasticity in older adults, with differential effects on brain structure and function between urban and rural participants, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches that consider sociocultural factors to optimize healthy aging across diverse populations.',

    title: 'The health economics of insulin therapy: How do we address the rising demands, costs, inequalities and barriers to achieving optimal outcomes.',
    abstract: `The health economic value of insulin is usually expressed within a cost-effectiveness framework providing an estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Insulin clinical trials adopt a treat-to-target design in which both intervention and control arms aim to achieve similar levels of glycaemic control thereby allowing a comparison of secondary safety outcomes such as hypoglycaemia and weight gain. While of use to inform clinicians about the new insulin's tolerability, it is of limited use for an economic evaluation. An insulin's true potential value requires an assessment of the relationship between the benefits of attaining individualised glycaemic goals versus the factors known to act as barriers to the initiation/intensification of insulin and that also contribute to poor adherence in clinical practice. Addressing the rising demands that diabetes will impose upon the healthcare system will require the simultaneous execution of multiple strategies that acknowledge population dynamics, healthcare delivery constraints, the role of innovation and funding requirements. Accounting for patient-specific characteristics to develop individualised plans and utilising technologies that address relevant barriers to care will require a whole-system perspective on healthcare value and an appreciation of the interconnectivity of stakeholder needs. Importantly, convenience and treatment satisfaction are often not considered valuable features of insulin therapy; not only do they have value, but they are essential to addressing rising demands. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: More people around the world are living with diabetes. This is because people are living longer, populations are getting older, and more people are developing the disease. Clinicians will have to prescribe insulin for more people. To make well-informed decisions about how to spend money on diabetes care, we need to understand how much therapies costs and how well they work. In healthcare, people often talk about "value for money." This means getting better results without spending more money, or saving money without making things worse. However, it's not always easy to figure out the value of new types of insulin. The way insulin is studied in clinical trials doesn't always relate well to how it works, and is used, in real-life clinical practice. Many studies don't look at all the things that matter, like how easy it is for people to use the insulin or how it affects their daily lives. When two types of insulin have comparable efficacy in terms of lowering blood sugar, other things - like side effects, how easy it is to use, and how well people stick to their treatment - become important drivers of value. These things are different for each person, may be left out of studies and may not considered to be important by decision makers. In this paper, we first discuss how the health economics of insulin has traditionally been studied, and look at the findings, advantages and disadvantages of these approaches. We also describe how tools like continuous glucose monitors (which track blood sugar all the time) can help people improve outcomes. We introduce what we call the "insulin value system." This looks at how the features of the insulin, the patient's circumstances, and the state of the healthcare system interact to determine the value of a new therapy. In the case of insulin therapies, traditional approaches to value assessment don't always capture the full picture. Our second goal is to talk about the big challenges in diabetes care, for which there are no easy solutions. More people are getting diabetes, and more money will be needed for treatment and disease management. We believe that to really help make a difference, we need to consider the whole healthcare system, how everything is connected, and not just focus on one part. We believe it's important to look at how people live and work, their personal circumstances and how they and the healthcare system interact when assessing the value of insulin. That way, we can better understand how new treatments can help both people and the wider healthcare system.`,

    title: 'Developmental characteristics of orientation and differentiation abilities in the control of jumping distance in preschool children.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The development of coordination abilities and fundamental motor skills in early childhood plays a crucial role in promoting physical activity and preventing obesity. However, only a few studies have investigated the developmental characteristics of coordination abilities during early childhood. Therefore, we used jumping distance control as a motor task to examine the developmental characteristics of orientation and differentiation abilities in early childhood.\n' +
      'METHODS: We included 318 children aged 3.5-6 years. The motor task was a box target jump test in which the participants jumped from a box approximately 30â€…cm in height, such that their heels were aligned with a target line 40â€…cm away. Each participant performed the test two times. The performance results from the two box jump test trials were analyzed by comparing the mean errors of the first and second trials, along with a more detailed examination through the analysis of the performance level ratios between the two trials.\n' +
      'RESULTS: While the participants aged 3.5 years displayed insufficient accuracy and a strong tendency toward underdevelopment (low-performance percentage for 3.5 years: 1stâ€‰=â€‰38.3%, 2ndâ€‰=â€‰38.3%, â€‰<â€‰0.001), immediate feedback effects began to appear at the age of 4 years (low-performance percentage for 4 years: 1stâ€‰=â€‰21.3%, 2ndâ€‰=â€‰14.9%). Behavioral changes, such as improved accuracy between trials, became more evident from 4.5 years of age. These results suggest an emerging capacity for motor adjustment or imagery, although no direct assessment of motor imagery was conducted in this study, and such interpretations remain speculative. By approximately 5 years of age, participants obtained a certain level of immediate feedback effect.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: These findings provide insight into the developmental characteristics of coordination abilities in early childhood and could help inform age-appropriate physical education approaches that support movement awareness and adaptive motor control.',

    title: 'Patient-Centered Care: A Qualitative Analysis of Patient and Caregiver Experiences in a Hospital at Home Program.',
    abstract: 'UNLABELLED: This descriptive qualitative study aimed to address a gap in the literature by exploring the experiences of Hospital at Home (HaH) patients and caregivers. HaH programs, which deliver hospital-level care to patients in their homes, are increasingly popular outside the United States. Yet, there is less emphasis on understanding the experiences of patients and caregivers while actively receiving hospital-level care in the home and how their insights can enhance care delivery. A purposeful sample of 12 patients and five caregivers participated in semistructured interviews during the acute care stage and 30 days after their discharge from hospital-level care in the home. Thematic analysis revealed three main themes: (1) patient-centered communication and education, (2) differences in medical care at home, and (3) the impact of technology on the overall experience. These themes provide valuable insights into the factors that patients and caregivers believe positively and negatively influence their experiences within the HaH program. Moreover, the themes highlight aspects of the HaH model that are important to patients/caregivers and those that can be improved.\n' +

    title: "Efficacy of United States' federally-funded interventions in increasing school capacities to improve student mental health and education outcomes in Tennessee.",
    abstract: "About two in five children and adolescents will meet the criteria for a mental disorder by age 18, and more than half of youth who are accessing mental health services receive them in an educational setting. Yet there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of school-based interventions on children's mental health and education outcomes. We examine the effectiveness of two key United States' federally-funded interventions for expanding school-based capacities to improve children's health and education outcomes-School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) and Advancing Wellness and Resiliency in Education (AWARE) grants-in a mixed method, longitudinal study of low-income, Tennessee children. We linked health insurance claims data for children enrolled in Tennessee's Medicaid program with administrative education records for students attending Tennessee public schools between 2006 and 2019. We also implemented a census of Tennessee school districts to determine which had SBHCs and AWARE grants and their start years, and we conducted semi-structured interviews with each treated district to assess their infrastructure, programs, staffing, partnerships, health services offered, and more. We estimated effects of SBHCs and AWARE grants on school-level rates of mental health conditions, behavioral health conditions, preventive health care visits, absences, chronic absences, and disciplinary incidents using a staggered adoption, difference-indifferences (DiD) approach. We found a statistically significant reduction in diagnosed mental health conditions among treated schools of 6 percent relative to their baseline prevalence, which our qualitative findings suggest might be related to increased health staffing in schools, earlier detection of mental health needs, and greater use of prevention strategies. We saw larger effects in some school districts with more extensive mental health infrastructure. We did not satisfy model assumptions for estimating causal effects on preventive health care visits, absences, chronic absences, and disciplinary incidents, although associations were in the expected direction.",

    title: 'Assessment of health information in Chinese atopic dermatitis-related videos: A cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is prevalent worldwide. People are increasingly obtaining health information through social videos. In China, the quality, reliability, understandability, and actionability of AD-related videos have yet to be fully studied.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study proposed to analyze AD-related videos on Chinese video-sharing platforms.\n' +
      `METHODS: Three keywords "" (atopic dermatitis) or "" (eczema) or "" (atopic eczema) were used on Bilibili and Douyin (Chinese version of TikTok) to retrieve videos from May 25 to November 25, 2024. Included videos' reliability was evaluated by the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) criteria and modified DISCERN (mDISCERN), quality was evaluated by Global Quality Scale (GQS), and understandability and actionability were evaluated by Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Spearman correlation was used to explore the correlation among different variables.\n` +
      "RESULTS: 368 videos were included, and the activity on Douyin was higher than that on Bilibili (â€‰<â€‰.001). Although Douyin's AD videos were rated higher than Bilibili's in reliability and understandability (all â€‰<â€‰.001), neither of them was satisfactory. Medical practitioners were the main source of videos (â€‰=â€‰326, 88.59%), mostly conveying treatment (â€‰=â€‰159, 43.21%). The videos they uploaded had higher ratings in the JAMA, mDISCERN and understandability, and were also more popular (all â€‰<â€‰.05). There were more videos on Bilibili that involved traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (â€‰=â€‰81, 52.60%); however, the ratings of such videos were lower than those without TCM on any platform (all â€‰<â€‰.001). Videos about treatment and prevention were almost the best two categories in terms of actionability (all â€‰<â€‰.05). The number of likes, shares, comments, collections, fans, the JAMA score, and understandability were positively correlated (all â€‰<â€‰.05).\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of AD-related videos flooding social media is suboptimal. Videos from professionals are more reliable and should be promoted. The public should exercise caution when searching for healthcare information on video platforms.',

    title: 'Evolution of a Training Program for Pediatric Faculty and Trainee Wellbeing.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: High rates of distress and burnout continue to plague physicians. The Sustaining and Training for Resilience, Engagement and Meaning (STREAM) curriculum is a Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) funded program, developed by experts in faculty and trainee wellbeing from 7 academic institutions, to help address this ongoing and pervasive issue.\n' +
      "METHODS: We used Kern's 6-step model to develop the STREAM program. STREAM content was developed and iteratively revised to highlight evidence-informed methods to improve wellbeing. STREAM content is grounded in the PERMA-H framework and highlights 4 pillars: Optimizing your Well-Being, Building Resilience, Collaborative Engagement to Improve your Work, and Connecting with Joy and Meaning in Medicine. Within sessions, implementation of skills was discussed at the individual level and within the work environment. This manuscript describes the process of development, implementation, and pilot program evaluation for the STREAM curriculum for the first 2 years.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Based on review and assessment of year 1, we made multiple revisions of the curriculum. We revised the original four pillars and strengthened connection with the PERMA-H model. We transitioned from synchronous virtual model to in-person sessions to enhance engagement, buy-in, and meaning. We further increased time with interactive elements and limited didactic content. We deepened content related to equity and inclusion. We separated faculty and resident sessions to improve community-building and group dynamics. Additionally, we provided the option for sessions to be delivered "a la carte," depending on the needs of the institution and participants.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The STREAM wellbeing curriculum is a promising model to promote positive behavior change in pediatric academic medicine. Curricular activities related to wellness may require adjustment and modifications while in process to improve delivery and participation-and enhance chances of successful education/training. We must continue to build evidence for the effectiveness of STREAM and other wellness interventions.',

    title: 'Performance of ChatGPT on the Plastic Surgery In-Training Examination.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Recently, the artificial intelligence chatbot Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) performed well on all United States Medical Licensing Examinations (USMLE), demonstrating a high level of insight into a physician's knowledge base and clinical reasoning ability. This study aims to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) Plastic Surgery In-Training Examination (PSITE) to assess its clinical reasoning and decision-making ability and investigate its legitimacy related to plastic surgery competencies.\n" +
      'METHODS: PSITE questions from 2015 to 2023 were included in this study. Questions with images, charts, and graphs were excluded. ChatGPT 3.5 was prompted to provide the best single letter answer choice. Performance was analyzed across test years, question area of content, taxonomy, and core competency via chi-square analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of ChatGPT performance.\n' +
      'RESULTS: In this study, 1850 of 2097 multiple choice questions were included. ChatGPT answered 845 (45.7%) questions correctly, performing the highest on breast/cosmetic topics (49.6%) ( = .070). ChatGPT performed significantly better on questions requiring the lowest level of reasoning (knowledge, 55.1%) compared with more complex questions such as analysis (41.4%) ( = .001). Multivariable analysis identified negative predictors of performance including the hand/lower extremity topic (OR = 0.73,  = .038) and taxonomy levels beyond knowledge ( < .05). Performance on the 2023 exam (53.4%) corresponded to a 4th percentile score when compared with all plastic surgery residents.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: While ChatGPT's performance has shown promise in other medical domains, our results indicate it may not be a reliable source of information for plastic surgery-related questions or decision-making.",

    title: 'Associated factors, emergency department visits, and hospitalization days of receiving adjunctive Chinese herbal medicine therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a nationwide cohort study in Taiwan.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Cancer prevention and treatment, particularly lung cancer, remain major healthcare challenges in Taiwan and globally. This study investigates factors and healthcare utilization patterns associated with adjunctive Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\n' +
      "METHODS: Using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and the Taiwan Cancer Registry, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of non-small cell lung cancer patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2013. Descriptive analysis, propensity score matching, and regression models were employed to assess CHM therapy utilization and its impact on emergency department visits and hospitalization days.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Among 43,122 non-small cell lung cancer patients, 5.76% received adjunctive CHM therapy, with the majority at stage IV cancer. Factors such as cancer stage, age, gender, marital status, education level, monthly salary, degree of urbanization, severity of comorbidity, comorbid diseases, hospital ownership, experience of using Chinese medicine, chemotherapy status, and years of diagnosis are significantly associated with whether NSCLC patients receive adjunctive CHM therapy. Patients receiving adjunctive CHM therapy for 181-365 days reduced emergency department visits by 16% (OR = 0.84, 95%CI: 0.74-0.95) and shortened hospitalization days by 17% (Ratio = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.75-0.91).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Prolonged adjunctive CHM therapy, particularly for 181-365 days, is associated with decreased healthcare utilization among non-small cell lung cancer patients. These findings suggest a potential role for extended CHM therapy in managing NSCLC and warrant consideration by clinical teams.',
