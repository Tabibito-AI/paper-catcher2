    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Economics students’ behavioural intention and usage of ChatGPT in higher education: a hybrid structural equation modelling-artificial neural network approach',
    abstract: 'Abstract The Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, popularly referred to as ChatGPT, is an AI-based technology with the potential to revolutionise conventional teaching and learning in higher education institutions (HEIs). However, it remains unclear which factors influence the behavioural intentions and the actual usage of ChatGPT among economics students in Ghanaian HEIs. In pursuit of this goal, we employed the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) to gain a better understanding of the antecedents influencing the behavioural intentions and actual usage of ChatGPT among economics students. The study surveyed 306 Ghanaian students enrolled in economics at a public university. These students were aware of the existence of ChatGPT applications. We applied a hybrid analytical approach, combining structural equation modelling and artificial neural network (SEM-ANN), to elucidate the causal relationships between variables believed to impact perceived trust, intentions, and actual usage. The results showed that design and interactivity have a significant impact on perceived trust. Similarly, perceived trust, social influence, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habits drive behavioural intentions. Among the various factors influencing behavioural intentions, hedonic motivation emerged as the most dominant. Moreover, behavioural intentions and facilitating conditions significantly drive students’ actual use of the ChatGPT. Nevertheless, ethics is not a significant factor in perceived trust, and effort expectancy does not affect behavioral intention. These findings, however, offer theoretical and practical contributions that can serve as guide for a thoughtful and responsible integration of AI-based tools as a future strategy to enhance education accessibility and inclusivity opportunities',

The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'The Future of Accounting Education Under the Developments in AI',
    summary: 'The development of science depends on the basics and principles of Science and scientific research in this science or field, and due to the fact that the nature of the science and field of accounting is developing and improving continuously and rapidly associated with many relationships and fields under many variables and factors, and then this research deals with difficulties between the three variables represented in scientific research, accounting education, and AI, specifically under of the widespread reliance on the preparation and preparation of scientific research using many advanced methods of AI, and then increasing the connection between and the development provided by scientific research. Accounting science and what is repeated in different formats follow the methods of AI. The research also aims to clarify the relationship between AI, accounting education, and accounting scientific research by conducting a questionnaire on a sample of 84 university professors and researchers in the field of accounting. The statistical analysis of the data collected by applying SPSS 25. It was concluded that the relationship between the three variables is considered close and interconnected. Without the first (accounting education), the development of the second (accounting scientific research) stops, which is considered inappropriate for the current business environment in all its categories, whether teaching or learning. Both scientific research and accounting education depend on the latter (AI) to provide technical and analytical support and classify opinions to reduce repetition and avoid deficiencies in the feasibility of research in accounting education.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Brain morphometry and chronic inflammation in Bangladeshi children growing up in extreme poverty.',
    abstract: 'Over three hundred million children live in environments of extreme poverty, and the biological and psychosocial hazards endemic to these environments often expose these children to infection, disease, and inflammatory responses. Chronic inflammation in early childhood has been associated with diminished cognitive outcomes, and despite this established relationship, the mechanisms explaining how inflammation affects brain development are not well known. Importantly, the prevalence of chronic inflammation in areas of extreme poverty raises the possibility that it may also serve as a mechanism explaining the known relationship between low socioeconomic status (SES) and altered brain development. To examine these potential pathways, seventy-nine children growing up in an extremely poor, urban area of Bangladesh underwent MRI scanning at 6 years of age. Structural brain images were submitted to Mindboggle software, a Docker-compliant and high-reproducibility tool for regional estimations of volume, surface area, cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and mean curvature. C-reactive protein was assayed at eight time points between infancy and 5 years of age, and the frequency with which children had elevated concentrations of inflammatory marker represented the measure of chronic inflammation. Childhood SES was measured with maternal education and income-to-needs (i.e., monthly household income divided by the number of household members). Chronic inflammation predicted volume in bilateral basal ganglia structures and mediated the link between maternal education and bilateral putamen volumes. These findings suggest that chronic inflammation is associated with brain morphometry in the basal ganglia, predominantly the putamen, and further offers inflammation as a potential mechanism linking SES to brain development.',

    title: 'Robotic-assisted technique in plastic and reconstructive surgery: Experience in Taiwan.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) has increasingly been applied in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery, offering enhanced precision, reduced invasiveness, and improved patient outcomes. This review summarizes Taiwan's pioneering experience with robotic-assisted techniques in this specialty, with an emphasis on clinical applications, educational models, and future directions.\n" +
      'METHODS: A narrative literature review was conducted focusing on robotic-assisted plastic and reconstructive surgery with relevance to Taiwanese clinical practice. Articles published between January 2000 and April 2024 were considered. Searches were performed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library using the keywords: "robotic surgery," "plastic surgery," "reconstructive surgery," "Taiwan," and "microsurgery." Inclusion criteria were: (1) studies involving robotic-assisted surgical techniques, (2) relevance to plastic and reconstructive surgery, (3) Taiwanese institutional or clinical context, and (4) availability of clinical or technical outcome data. Articles not published in English, lacking original data, or unrelated to the Taiwan context were excluded.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Robotic-assisted techniques were successfully applied in various reconstructive domains, notably in microsurgical anastomosis for free flap procedures, nerve transfers, and minimally invasive mastectomies. These approaches demonstrated favorable outcomes in terms of operative precision, reduced complications, and patient satisfaction. Taiwan's major medical centers, including Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Taichung Veterans General Hospital, have been instrumental in driving these innovations. Furthermore, robotic training models facilitated the learning curve for microsurgeons and supported the integration of robotic platforms into surgical education.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: Taiwan's experience underscores the feasibility and clinical value of robotic-assisted techniques in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Robotic platforms not only improve surgical outcomes but also expand the scope of reconstructive options. Ongoing research and educational efforts are crucial to optimizing technique standardization and surgeon training in this rapidly evolving field.",

    title: 'Factors associated with influenza vaccine adherence among health care workers in Abu Dhabi.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Influenza outbreaks rapidly threaten public health, making vaccination a critical tool in reducing transmission. Health care workers (HCWs), especially those in direct patient care roles within all health care settings, are encouraged to receive annual influenza vaccinations to enhance their immunity and ensure patient safety.\n' +
      "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify and describe the factors associated with HCWs' adherence to annual influenza vaccination within a United Arab Emirates (UAE) hospital and provide recommendations to improve adherence rates.\n" +
      'METHOD: Using a quantitative approach, a questionnaire based on the Health Belief Model and existing literature was administered to all 2,080 staff members of the UAE hospital under study. Of these, 1018 participants completed the questionnaire.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The study uncovered several key factors influencing HCWs' influenza vaccine uptake. Notably, social influence from colleagues emerged as a significant factor, alongside barriers, such as inconvenient vaccination times, limited awareness of hospital policies, an absence of follow-up by the hospital administration, a lack of prior influenza cases and fear of injections. Motivational factors included the desire to protect friends and family, employer recommendations, mandatory policies and HCWs' intrinsic motivation to safeguard patients.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: The findings of the study informed recommendations to enhance vaccination rates. These recommendations include health education materials, social media awareness campaigns, mandatory vaccination policies, on-duty vaccination services, free vaccination, flexible post-vaccination recovery time, special sick leave policies and vaccine benefit awareness.\n' +

    title: 'German veterinarians asked: a cross-sectional study on microbiological examination and antimicrobial use in canine reproductive medicine.',
    abstract: 'Despite the growing global threat of antimicrobial resistance, many dog breeders still request antimicrobial treatment prior to mating, often based on vaginal bacterial culture examinations. However, several previous studies failed to identify differences in the vaginal microbiota between healthy dogs and those with reproductive tract disorders; thus, treating healthy bitches with antimicrobials regardless of the bacterial findings is contraindicated. To investigate current practices of German small animal veterinarians regarding microbiological sampling and antimicrobial treatment in canine reproductive medicine, we conducted an online survey using LimeSurvey®. The questionnaire included questions (single/multiple choice) about procedures of microbiological swab sampling and handling in general and in canine reproductive medicine specifically, as well as on antimicrobial use in the respective field. The objective was to identify educational and research needs regarding vaginal bacterial culture interpretation and antimicrobial treatment in canine breeding. We found that treating clinically healthy breeding bitches remains common practice among both breeders and veterinarians. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous education and improved communication to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use in canine reproduction. Furthermore, research on the reproductive microbiome in relation to fertility is essential for evidence-based treatment decisions.',

    title: '"Service" versus "Education" in Anesthesiology: Domain Classification of Activities Based on Perceptions from Learners and Teachers.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: In the US, ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) mandates a balance between education and service for the quality of graduate medical education. However, the scope of "education" and "service" in Anesthesiology remains undefined.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was designed, validated, and distributed in a major academic Anesthesiology training program to assess the perceived educational value associated with routine anesthesia training activities. Using the latent variable exploratory factor analysis, domains of activities were identified according to perceived educational values. These domains along with learning climate were then compared among teachers and learners.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Three domains of activities were identified with a completion rate of 52.5%: 1) Mandatory training-related obligations (patient transport, call duties, medical record and ACGME record documentation, etc) were associated with the least educational value, 2) Procedural responsibilities (arterial line placement, epidural analgesia, etc) and 3) Classroom activities (simulation, mock oral exam, etc) were associated with higher educational value. Learning climate factors (fatigue, excessive caseload, etc) adversely affects the perception of educational value in learners more significantly than in teachers.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: There is disparity in the perception of educational value for various training activities between learners and teachers. Learners perceive lower educational value in anesthesia training activities compared to teachers, especially in mandatory tasks. Modifiable elements of the learning climate should be addressed to enhance the educational experience for learners.',

    title: 'Effects of genetic factors and visual behaviors on interventions for myopia prevention and control in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Childhood myopia has become a global public health problem and is growing rapidly in incidence, especially in East Asia. This study examined the prevention and control of myopia in children by systematically evaluating the interaction between genetic factors and visual behaviors to optimize prevention strategies.\n' +
      'METHODS: Relevant articles were screened from PubMed and Web of Science. The search period was from January 2000 to January 2024. Inclusion criteria were children aged 6-18 years with clear stratification into intervention groups (receiving specific measures: health education, ≥1 hour daily outdoor activity, optical correction, or 0.01% atropine) and control groups (receiving routine care or no intervention). Both groups were matched for age (±1 year), baseline refractive error (within 0.50 D), and family history of myopia. Including health education, behavior adjustment, outdoor activities, clinically and research-proven interventions for myopia progression delay (including optical interventions such as frame glasses and orthokeratology, and pharmacological interventions such as low-concentration atropine). Outcome indicators included incidence of myopia, change in refractive power (D), and change in axial length (mm). Data were analyzed via RevMan 5.4 (Cochrane) and Stata 16 (StataCorp), and the effects of interventions were assessed using a random-effects model. This article defines the terms randomized controlled trials (RCTs), standardized mean difference (SMD), relative risk (RR), and confidence interval (CI).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Twelve high-quality studies that examined the intervention effects of multiple genetic factors and visual behavior were ultimately included, with a total sample of 6,342 cases. The results showed that interventions significantly slowed myopia progression in the genetic high-risk group compared to its control, though the absolute effect remained weaker than in the general population, especially in terms of changes in refractive power (diopters, D) and axial length (millimeters, mm) (SMD =-0.32; 95% CI: -0.5 to -0.13). Among the interventions, health education and outdoor activities were the most effective for myopia prevention and control, with a reduction in the incidence of myopia of approximately 12% (myopia incidence rate =0.88; 95% CI: 0.81-0.96). Adherence to intervention was closely related to the effect of intervention, and the group with higher adherence experienced better control of myopia progression.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Genetic factors and visual behavior have significant effects on the prevention and control of myopia in children. The prevention and control of myopia among genetic high-risk population are significantly improved after the application of health education and outdoor activity plan interventions. Improving the compliance of intervention is the key factor to enhancing the effect of childhood intervention. This meta-analysis provides a scientific basis for the optimization of childhood intervention strategies for the prevention and control of myopia in children.',

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Burn injuries represent a critical global public health issue, significantly threatening human life and well-being, particularly among children. This study aims to systematically summarize the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with extremely severe burns in northern China.\n' +
      "METHODS: This study retrospectively collected clinical data from 101 pediatric patients with extremely severe burns treated at Beijing Children's Hospital between 2013 and 2023. The data collected included gender, age, cause of injury, location of the incident, length of stay (LOS), total burn surface area (TBSA) and mortality.\n" +
      'RESULTS: A total of 101 pediatric patients with extremely severe burns (51.49% male) were included in this study, representing 5.7% of all burn-related hospitalizations at our hospital over an 11-year period. The annual number of admissions for extremely severe burns exhibited an overall declining trend. The highest proportion of cases occurred in children aged 1 to 3 years (61.4%). Two causes of injury were identified, with scalds constituting the majority (81.2%). Notably, flame burns (18.8%) were associated with a high wound infection rate (89.5%), and wound infection emerged as a significant factor influencing the LOS. More than half of the patients presented with extensive burns to the head and neck regions. Additionally, there were 8 fatalities among the 101 patients.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: In Northern China, scalding is the predominant cause of extremely severe burns in children. Children aged 1 to 3 years should be the primary target group for prevention efforts. It is essential to enhance safety education at both family and society levels.',

    title: 'Paediatric Fournier gangrene: comprehensive insights into diagnosis, management, and outcomes-a narrative review.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Fournier gangrene (FG) is an uncommon, severe condition characterized by the onset of severe tissue infection in the perineal area, with significant implications for the pediatric population. The current review has been drafted to shed light on the various aspects of pediatric FG, including its etiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, management strategies, and outcomes.\n' +
      'METHODS: A comprehensive review of pediatric FG was conducted on the existing data on its strategies, clinical features, complications, treatments, and outcomes. A detailed literature search was done on databases using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science with keywords such as "Fournier gangrene", "Pediatric Fournier gangrene", "Fournier gangrene in children", and "necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI)". Due to the limited pediatric data, adult FG data were used to explain the diagnostic scoring system, treatment strategies.\n' +
      'KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: The review highlights the prevalence of FG in pediatric populations and reinforces the requirement for early diagnosis with prompt medical intervention to manage pediatric FG. The etiology and pathophysiology of pediatric FG are also discussed, along with the underlying causes and specific risk factors such as existing congenital abnormalities of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal systems. The management of pediatric FG requires the implementation of a multidisciplinary approach, which should begin with immediate clinical intervention, proper surgical procedures, implementation of pharmacological therapies, and antibiotic regimens to avoid potential complications. Preventive strategies should focus on public health education, hygiene, and vaccination to boost immunity and prevent pediatric FG. The current review suggests future directions to ameliorate clinical practices and achieve favourable outcomes in managing pediatric FG.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: FG, despite its rare occurrence in the pediatric population, poses a humongous challenge to the healthcare community owing to its rapid onset, complex diagnosis, and high morbidity and mortality rates. Early diagnosis, combined with prompt medical and surgical intervention, with a coordinated multidisciplinary approach, is essential in the management of FG in children. The review provides a glimpse of the shortcomings of the healthcare system and emphasizes the need to improve treatment protocols while also evaluating the long-term impacts of the disease.',

    abstract: "Since the turn of the century, sociologists and other scholars concerned about digital inequality have most often been concerned about disparities in the quality of internet use, not necessarily the availability of internet access itself. However, the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the fact that the internet's potential benefits to mitigating the spread of the virus were only available to those with internet access. In this visualization, I use household-level data from the American Community Survey from 2013 - 2023 (N = 10,713,204 households) to estimate a linear probability model predicting internet access by race/ethnicity, household educational attainment, and poverty status. Results suggest that household internet access has increased over the past decade, but disparities still exist on all three dimensions.",
