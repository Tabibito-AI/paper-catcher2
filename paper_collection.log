    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +
      'national income model, government-purchases multiplier and tax multiplier.',

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'educational attainment can predict upward income and occupational mobility even\n' +
      'within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin\n' +
      'Longitudinal Study (WLS), I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment\n' +
      'predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when\n' +

      'is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is\n' +
      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +
      'our understanding of longitudinal inequality and shed light on the sources of\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +
      'propose a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +
      'Linear amplification yields S-functions as only analytic solutions.\n' +

      'reproduces all peaceful data from 1800 to date without adjustable parameter. It\n' +
      'has full forecasting power since the decisive parameters are constants of the\n' +

    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'The Future of Accounting Education Under the Developments in AI',
    summary: 'The development of science depends on the basics and principles of Science and scientific research in this science or field, and due to the fact that the nature of the science and field of accounting is developing and improving continuously and rapidly associated with many relationships and fields under many variables and factors, and then this research deals with difficulties between the three variables represented in scientific research, accounting education, and AI, specifically under of the widespread reliance on the preparation and preparation of scientific research using many advanced methods of AI, and then increasing the connection between and the development provided by scientific research. Accounting science and what is repeated in different formats follow the methods of AI. The research also aims to clarify the relationship between AI, accounting education, and accounting scientific research by conducting a questionnaire on a sample of 84 university professors and researchers in the field of accounting. The statistical analysis of the data collected by applying SPSS 25. It was concluded that the relationship between the three variables is considered close and interconnected. Without the first (accounting education), the development of the second (accounting scientific research) stops, which is considered inappropriate for the current business environment in all its categories, whether teaching or learning. Both scientific research and accounting education depend on the latter (AI) to provide technical and analytical support and classify opinions to reduce repetition and avoid deficiencies in the feasibility of research in accounting education.',

    title: 'Digital University: Building a Flexible, Inclusive, and Sustainable Education System',
    summary: "This paper explores the concept of a “Digital University” aimed at reshaping higher education to align with the needs of a digital economy. The study introduces a comprehensive model that integrates innovative digital solutions to enhance learning experiences, streamline university management, and develop core digital competencies among students. Using empirical data from five universities in Uzbekistan, the research examines the readiness of educational institutions to adopt digital infrastructure, faculty competencies in utilizing digital tools, and student satisfaction with technology-based learning. Findings indicate that digital integration positively influences educational outcomes, supporting the model's potential as a transformative approach in higher education. The study's novelty lies in its structural framework for a Digital University, emphasizing flexibility, inclusivity, and sustainability. This model not only enhances academic experiences but also positions universities to respond effectively to the growing demands of the digital economy.",

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: "Epigenetic Mediating Mechanisms in Parkinson's Disease: The Impact of Educational Attainment on SETD1A Expression.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: This study investigated the interplay between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, aiming to identify key factors and their impact on disease progression.\n" +
      'METHODS: Leveraging genome-wide association study data of PD and environmental-related factors, in conjunction with blood expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and methylation QTLs data, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), summary data-based MR (SMR), and colocalization analysis to explore the association between environmental, epigenetic, and genetic factors and PD risk. We also conducted transcriptomic analysis of the targeted gene and investigated its functional mechanism in PD with mouse datasets. A meta-analysis of relevant prospective cohort studies was also conducted to validate the links between the identified environmental factor and PD risk.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Five modifiable factors were identified as associated with PD, including educational attainment. SMR and colocalization analysis demonstrated 14 methylation sites linked to the expression of eight genes and PD risk. Among them, six methylation sites might affect the expression of SET Domain Containing 1A (SETD1A). Furthermore, prolonged educational attainment was found to be causally associated with hypermethylation of cg09162137, which downregulated SETD1A and impacted PD risk. Transcriptomic analysis indicated lower expression of SETD1A in PD cases. Pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis suggested that SETD1A might influence mitochondrial function and α-synuclein pathogenesis. Finally, a meta-analysis indicated that higher education levels increased PD risk (hazard ratio = 1.15) but did not affect other PD progression phenotypes except cognition.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: We identified five modifiable factors associated with PD. Higher education attainment might increase PD risk by affecting the expression of SETD1A. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.',

    title: 'National Patterns of Remote Patient Monitoring Service Availability at US Hospitals.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Digital remote patient monitoring (RPM), such as home-based blood pressure, heart rate, or weight monitoring, enables longitudinal care outside traditional health care settings, especially in the vulnerable period after hospitalizations, with broad coverage of the service by payers. We sought to evaluate patterns of RPM service availability at US hospitals and the characteristics of hospitals and the counties they serve that are associated with the availability of these services.\n' +
      'METHODS: We used national data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey from 2018 to 2022 to ascertain US hospitals offering RPM services for postdischarge or chronic care. We linked hospitals with their census-based county-level data to define the characteristics of the counties they serve, including sociodemographic features such as age distribution, racial/ethnic composition, median household income, education level, and disability status. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess associations between hospital- and county-level characteristics and RPM availability, adjusting for hospital size, region, teaching status, and ownership.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The study included 5644 hospitals. Over 5 years of study, there was a 40.3% increase in the number of hospitals offering RPM services, rising from 1364 (33.0%) hospitals in 2018 to 1797 (46.3%) in 2022. In 2022, hospitals with >300 beds had 3.7-fold odds of offering RPM compared with those with <100 beds (adjusted odds ratio, 3.71 [95% CI, 2.90-4.74]). Nonteaching hospitals had lower odds of RPM availability than teaching hospitals (adjusted odds ratio, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.19-0.44]), and rural hospitals had lower odds than urban hospitals (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.32-0.77]).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: In this national study of US hospitals, there has been a large increase in the availability of RPM services but with large variation among hospitals, with lower availability in hospitals serving low-income and rural counties.',

    title: 'Organizational mediators of sustainability in a randomized controlled trial.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Prior systematic reviews and research have suggested that certain organizational characteristics and training methods may support the sustainability of new practices, yet these factors have not been adequately studied in behavioral health.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test the indirect effects of training design (e.g., training condition and consultation call attendance) on clinician-reported sustainability through post-training organizational resources, training exposure and utilization, and organizational climate.\n' +
      'METHOD: Fifty licensed outpatient clinics, including 100 clinicians, 50 supervisors, and 50 administrators were randomized to one of three training conditions: 1) Learning Collaborative (LC), 2) Cascading Model (CM) or 3) Distance Education (DE). All were trained to provide Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Data to assess training and implementation outcomes were collected at 4 time points coinciding with the training period: baseline, 6- (mid), 12- (post), and 24-months (1-year follow-up). Multi-level path analysis was utilized to examine the role of organizational barriers and training approaches on sustainability of PCIT (caseload, protocol use, number of families seen).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Clinician-reported resources, training exposure and utilization, and organizational climate varied among study conditions, with the most favorable conditions reported in the CM condition and the least favorable conditions reported in the LC condition. The CM condition was associated with greater PCIT caseload, more families served by the PCIT program, and less use of the full PCIT protocol as compared to the DE condition, while the LC condition was associated with fewer families served and more use of the full PCIT protocol.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Organizational factors such as available resources, organizational climate, and training exposure and utilization indirectly influence the effect of training approach and consultation on PCIT sustainability two years after baseline and vary based on condition. A possible mechanism of the cascading training model on sustainability, through increased organizational resources, was also identified.',

    title: "Exploring Pain Clinical Specialists' Perspectives on Opioid Optimization for Chronic Non-Malignant Pain in England.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The use of opioids for chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) offers limited efficacy and carries the potential for addiction. Healthcare professionals in both primary and secondary care settings face challenges when attempting to optimise opioid medications. There are limited studies that investigated the barriers and enablers to opioid reduction, cessation, and optimisation, specifically from a pain clinical specialist perspective.\n' +
      "OBJECTIVE: This study explores pain clinical specialists' views on challenges in opioid prescription management-including optimization and tapering-and their interactions with patients and prescribers.\n" +
      'METHODS: Participants were recruited through pain clinic, webinars Email outreach, and professional networks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using a guide based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) with 11 pain clinical specialists (8 consultants and 3 pharmacists) from NHS England, out of 15 participants who initially expressed interest, recruited via professional networks. Thematic analysis employed Framework Approach with dual coding.\n' +
      'KEY FINDINGS: Eleven participants, comprising eight pain doctors and three clinical pharmacists, provided insights. Analysis revealed four key findings: (1) A paradigm shift away from long-term opioid therapy due to concerns about dependency and inadequate pain relief; (2) Strong preference for multidisciplinary, personalized treatment approaches; (3) Significant system-level barriers including care fragmentation and inadequate consultation time; (4) Critical need for enhanced clinician training and patient education programs.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Optimizing opioid use for CNMP requires fundamental changes to current practice, including implementation of integrated care pathways, extended consultation times, and comprehensive education initiatives. These findings provide evidence-based recommendations for improving pain management while reducing inappropriate opioid prescribing.',

    title: "Effectiveness of Local Mother's Kitchen Recipe Talks in Reducing the Burden of Anemia Among Children Under Five, Adolescents, Pregnant Women, and Lactating Mothers in Guntur District, India: A Community-Based Intervention Trial.",
    abstract: "Background Iron deficiency anemia remains a significant public health concern, particularly among vulnerable groups such as children under five, adolescents, pregnant women, and lactating mothers in low- and middle-income countries. Sustainable, community-driven dietary interventions leveraging locally available foods could provide a culturally acceptable alternative. Objective This study assesses the effectiveness of a community-based intervention that incorporates local mother's kitchen recipes and nutrition education talks in enhancing hemoglobin and dietary iron intake levels among targeted groups in the Guntur District, India. Materials and methods A one-year community-based intervention trial was conducted in two randomly selected villages, with one village as the intervention arm and the other as the control. A total of 504 participants were enrolled, including children under five, primary school children, and adolescents. The intervention included hands-on cooking sessions that promoted iron-rich, locally available recipes, as well as structured educational talks. Hemoglobin, dietary iron levels, and anthropometric measurements were assessed at baseline and at the post-intervention time point. Data analysis involved difference-in-difference analysis and McNemar tests to assess changes in key parameters. Results Participants who attended more than six sessions demonstrated an increase in hemoglobin levels, particularly among children under five (β = 0.70, 95% CI: -0.24 to 1.60) and primary school children (β = 0.40, 95% CI: -0.74 to 1.54). Significant reductions in stunting (92% to 7.7%), underweight, and wasting were observed in children under five. While some reproductive-age women showed declining dietary iron levels, hemoglobin levels improved. Conclusion The mother's kitchen model fosters sustainable dietary modifications, improving anemia status and nutritional outcomes beyond pharmacological supplementation.",

    title: 'The Impact of Socioeconomic Factors on Mental Health: A Conceptual Framework.',
    abstract: 'Income, education, occupation, and social position are all examples of socioeconomic factors that shape mental health outcomes significantly. This review carries a conceptual framework to describe the complex interaction between mental health and these socioeconomic determinants. It integrates existing theoretical models and empirical evidence while highlighting the pathways through which socioeconomic disparities affect psychological well-being. Access to resources, exposure to stressors, neighborhood environment, and social support networks are key mechanisms of change. Further, it considers how race, gender, and age intersect with these variables. The overall objective of this review is to offer an inclusive approach that can be used as a basis for policy formulation aimed at addressing mental health disparities and promoting resilience among different population groups. It highlights a need for a multi-disciplinary approach to political interventions that tackles socioeconomic origins of mental health issues by indicating the requirement for system transformation leading to fairer conditions for persons with mental illness, since it is the only solution that can address the behaviors of individuals in any society equally, regardless of their economic or social background.',
