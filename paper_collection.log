    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +
      'national income model, government-purchases multiplier and tax multiplier.',

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'established that this PGS predicts wages, income, and occupational prestige and\n' +

      'educational attainment can predict upward income and occupational mobility even\n' +
      'within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin\n' +
      'Longitudinal Study (WLS), I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment\n' +
      'predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when\n' +
      'respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about\n' +

      'covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status,\n' +
      'is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is\n' +
      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +
      'our understanding of longitudinal inequality and shed light on the sources of\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +
      'propose a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +
      'Linear amplification yields S-functions as only analytic solutions.\n' +

      'quantitative information on long-term demand. The theory is self-consistent. It\n' +
      'reproduces all peaceful data from 1800 to date without adjustable parameter. It\n' +
      'has full forecasting power since the decisive parameters are constants of the\n' +

    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Digitalization of Higher Education: Experience of Implementation',
    summary: 'In the article is considered the analysis of digitalization impact on the education system, the scientific view of its impact on the education system is analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of the impact of digitalization are revealed, the perspectives and trends of digitalization in the education system of the Republic of Uzbekistan are described. The beginning of the twenty-first century is due to the active implementation of digitalization processes in the modern economy. The digital economy touches every aspect of life: healthcare, education, online banking, and government. Modern Uzbekistan is a part of the world economic community, in this regard, the processes taking place in the international market require active entry into the global information community. For this purpose, Uzbekistan has paid special attention to the development of ICT since the early 1990s. Authors analyze the concepts and the ways of development of the digital transformation in education, examine the main trends in the e-learning market in Uzbekistan, and also identify the perspectives of its development and the features of new digital skills and competencies of its participants. In the article examined the results of active implementation of digital technologies in the educational system during recent years in Uzbekistan, it is concluded that the digitalization promotes the improvement of accessibility and quality of higher education. Creating digital platforms, developing online courses and distance learning allow for more effective interaction between students and teachers, opening up new opportunities for the formation of highly competitive workforce. Implementation of digital innovations in the field of education plays a crucial role in training of young specialists capable of successfully integration into the global economy and an information society.',

Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    summary: 'This study aims to analyze the user experience of virtual pedagogy in architecture education. It seeks to gather valuable feedback and perceptions from teachers and students regarding the effectiveness, challenges, and benefits of virtual pedagogy. The study employs a quantitative research design using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the user experience, challenges, advantages, and overall satisfaction with virtual pedagogy in architecture education. The findings reveal the widespread use of tools and applications, such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and Zoom etc., for delivering both studio-based and non-studio-based courses in the virtual learning environment. The study highlights several challenges associated with virtual pedagogy, particularly for studio-based subjects, including the lack of in-person experience crucial for effective learning, difficulties in providing hands-on training, discouragement of active learning, and inadequate access to specialized tools and software. Additionally, the findings indicate that while virtual pedagogy offers flexibility and accessibility, it faces challenges in replicating the spontaneous interactions and hands-on nature of traditional in-person design studios.',

    summary: 'As digital privacy becomes a critical concern across industries, structured education in this field is urgently needed. To address this gap, ACM, IEEE, and IFIP have launched a collaborative initiative to develop a Privacy Curricular Guideline for graduate programs. This framework defines core knowledge areas and aligns academic training with real-world needs. A Joint Taks Force of global experts identified eight foundational pillars for digital privacy education: (1) Privacy Body of Knowledge, (2) Privacy Foundations, (3) General Computer Science Concepts for Privacy, (4) Privacy-Preserving Computer Science/Software Engineering, (5) Information Systems/Technology, (6) Privacy Development Lifecycle, (7) Applied Domains, and (8) Privacy-related Industry Perspective. These are now being refined by dedicated Working Groups. This work is highly relevant to IFIP TC11 WG11.8, as privacy complements security but requires distinct focus areas addressing issues of user autonomy, data governance, and ethical considerations. Currently, privacy topics are often scattered across computer security and information security courses, leaving graduates unprepared for specialized privacy technologist roles. The initiative aims to bridge the education-practice gap and equip students with skills for emerging privacy challenges.',

    summary: 'Blockchain’s spontaneous consensus mechanism, characterized by technologies of decentralization, immutability, high transparency, and codification, helps address agency costs and the formalization of shareholder meetings in traditional corporate governance. With the advancement of blockchain technology, the integration of legal rules and code rules in corporate governance has become the new norm. As per the transaction cost theory of law and economics and the Coase Theorem, blockchain has promoted changes in governance rules by markedly reducing agency costs within companies. Corporate governance will exhibit partial and gradual adjustments when blockchain technology substantially diminishes these costs but falls short of achieving the optimal state of zero transaction costs. These changes not only enhance the transparency and efficiency of corporate governance but also effectively curb the misconduct of controlling shareholders and protect the rights of minority shareholders.',

    abstract: 'PURPOSE: To externally validate our surgical skill assessment system, which provides comprehensive real-time feedback based on motion capture (Mocap) metrics of laparoscopic instruments in simulation training environments.\n' +
      "METHODS: Participants conducted periaortic tissue dissection (Dissection Task) and parenchymal closure of the kidney (Suturing Task) using porcine cadaveric organs. Surgical instrument movements were measured by the MoCap system, and all training sessions were video-recorded. Utilizing our previously developed machine-learning (ML) algorithm, participants received quantitative feedback based on their motion features immediately after the training, including three-tier classification results, which meant their skill levels being consistent with those with  to ≤ 9 surgical caseloads of laparoscopy (novice), 10  to ≤ 49 (intermediate), and  50 (experienced), and predicted Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) scores. Automatically generated feedback comments were also provided through explainable artificial intelligence technology, and participants' satisfaction with this skill assessment system was also recorded. For the three-tier classifications, accuracy was calculated by comparison between estimated and actual surgical experience levels. The correlation and mean absolute error (MAE) were calculated between the algorithm-predicted and expert-evaluated mean GOALS scores.\n" +
      "RESULTS: A total of 38 urologists, 4 junior residents, and 10 medical students voluntarily participated in the current training. Several participants repeatedly performed the training, and so 107 datasets were included in the present analysis. Validation analyses demonstrated overall classification accuracies of 67.3 and 56.9% for Dissection Task and Suturing Task, respectively, when excluding the subsequent data of repeaters. In terms of GOALS score prediction, the correlation coefficient and MAE were 0.86 and 2.51  1.82 for Dissection Task, and 0.91 and 1.56  1.20 for Suturing Task, respectively, when compared with experts' evaluations. Overall, 88% of the participants found the feedback easy to understand, and 75% of participants were satisfied with the evaluation.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Our real-time feedback system was viewed favorably by the participants, and the ML algorithm was a reliable method, especially the predicted GOALS score. This system could facilitate objective performance assessment, enhance simulation-based training efficacy, and potentially accelerate surgical skill acquisition.',

    title: 'Inequality in Exposure and Knowledge Drives Vulnerability to Rat-Associated Leptospirosis.',
    abstract: "To predict and prevent public health risks from urban rats, studies often examine zoonotic pathogen prevalence in rats in different urban environments. However, human exposure to rats and their awareness of the associated risks are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to identify factors associated with two aspects of vulnerability to leptospirosis as a model rat-associated disease: (1) exposure to rat urine in the home and (2) lack of awareness that rats carry leptospirosis. To collect data on residents' experiences and knowledge about rats, we mailed a survey to randomly selected households along an income gradient in Chicago. Of 432 complete cases, 36% had observed rat urine in the home and 73% were unaware that rats carry leptospirosis. Using logistic regression, we found that non-white respondents had over three times higher odds of observing rat urine in the home than white respondents. Dog owners and respondents who sought out information about rats, regardless of source, were more likely to be aware that rats carry leptospirosis. When we examined both aspects of vulnerability simultaneously using multinomial regression, we found that residents most vulnerable to leptospirosis (who had been exposed to urine and were not aware that rats carry leptospirosis) were significantly less likely to be white and less likely to be dog owners. Our results suggest that more public education is needed about rat-associated diseases spread through feces and urine and that exposure to rats should be considered another environmental health burden that is disproportionately persistent in underserved communities of color.",

    title: 'Patterns of spinal injections following lumbar fusion surgery: a nationwide cohort study with 3-year follow-up.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: While lumbar fusion surgery is widely performed for degenerative conditions, postoperative pain management often requires additional interventions. This study aimed to investigate the patterns and timing of spinal injections within three years after lumbar fusion surgery.\n' +
      'METHODS: The study analyzed data from the Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service database, including 82,951 patients who underwent lumbar fusion surgery between 2013 and 2015 for degenerative spinal conditions. Patient outcomes were tracked for three years to assess the proportion receiving different injection types (epidural blocks, medial branch blocks, and facet joint blocks), including temporal trends and reoperation rates.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Within three years post-fusion, 36.1% received epidural blocks, 12.8% received medial branch blocks, and 6.2% received facet joint blocks. The mean time to first injection was 422 ± 303 days. Injection rates were highest in the first 6 months (29.6% of all first injections), gradually declining thereafter. Patients receiving injections showed higher reoperation rates (15.4-18.9%) compared to those without injections (4.2-7.5%).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study reveals substantial utilization of spinal injections post-fusion, with epidural blocks being predominant.

    title: 'Personality traits and resident education preferences within general surgery.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: General surgery residents encounter a myriad of learning environments, each involving teaching styles that may or may not align with trainees' preferred learning styles. Moreover, trainees' preferred learning styles are likely influenced by their personality traits such as their degree of introversion/extraversion. We aimed to investigate general surgery residents' personality traits and how this may impact their preferred learning styles in various environments.\n" +
      "METHODS: In March 2024, a cross-sectional survey was distributed to general surgery residents at four academic tertiary-care institutions. The survey assessed degree of introversion/extraversion through 9 questions from the validated Big 5 Personality Trait model. Based on the distribution of subject's scores, participants were binned into three groups: more introverted, intermediate, and more extraverted. The survey then asked questions about learning preferences in various surgical education environments including lectures, simulations, and in the operating room. Subjects were asked to place, in rank order, the educational and motivational value of various teaching methods within each environment.\n" +
      'RESULTS: A total of 66 out of 300 eligible residents completed the survey (22%). For lecture participation modalities, introverted residents found anonymous audience polls most educational and questions to specific individuals least educational. Extraverted residents were evenly distributed on the educational value of various lecture participation modalities. Introverted residents found a required skills competition least motivational whereas extraverted residents found it the most motivational. For intraoperative educational modalities, across all residents, receiving feedback on operative technique was the most educational and motivational.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: In this study, links between residents' degree of extraversion and modifiable learning environment preferences were elucidated. We found differences in what introverted and extraverted residents found to be the most educational in lecture and simulation environments. These preferences highlight the importance of tailoring learning environments to optimize the educational growth of different residents.",

    title: 'Surgeon Attitudes to Guideline-Concordant Extended Pharmacologic Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis after Cancer Surgery Within a Regional Health System: A Qualitative Study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: While infrequent, venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after cancer surgery. Extended pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (ePPX) decreases VTE risk and is recommended by professional societies. Observational studies have shown limited ePPX utilization, although reasons for non-adherence have not been forthcoming from existing data.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain insight toward surgeon practices and attitudes regarding ePPX within a regional health system.\n' +
      'METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 surgeons and 2 advanced practice providers who perform gastrointestinal, urologic, or gynecologic cancer resections. Interviews characterized perceptions of VTE risk, VTE prevention strategies, and an electronic medical record-based decision support tool to improve ePPX utilization. Transcripts were thematically analyzed with conceptual coding.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Thirteen surgeons and two advance-practice providers were interviewed; 5 were female. Six surgeons practice in the community and seven practice in the academic setting. Sixty percent (n = 9; 8 academic) of providers utilized ePPX 'routinely', with professional society guidelines and medical literature the most cited reasons. Thirty-three percent (n = 5; 4 community) of providers utilized ePPX 'selectively', with injection medication and surgeon routine the most cited reasons. One community surgeon 'never' utilized ePPX. Academic providers were more likely to utilize ePPX than community providers. All providers were open to the electronic medical record decision support tool.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Diverse practice patterns of ePPX were identified across providers, with community surgeons more likely to prescribe ePPX selectively or never. Surgeon education, utilization of an oral medication, and cost mitigation may improve ePPX adherence.',

    abstract: 'Weed management is a critical factor influencing returns yield and economic returns of dill (Anethum graveolens L.). A field experiment was conducted during the rabi seasons of 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 at MPUA&T, Udaipur, Rajasthan, to evaluate the efficacy of various weed control strategies in dill cultivation. The study, laid out in a randomized block design with three replications, comprised thirteen weed control treatments, including pre and post emergence herbicides and integrated approaches. The application of oxadiargyl at 75 g/ha as a pre-emergence herbicide, followed by hand weeding at 40 days after sowing (DAS), resulted in the highest weed control efficiency (96.42% at 60 DAS) and significantly reduced weed density and biomass. This treatment improved growth attributes such as plant height, dry matter accumulation, and branches per plant, leading to a 61.58% increase in seed yield (7.66 q/ha) compared to the weedy check (4.74 q/ha). Economic analysis revealed that this integrated approach provided the highest net return (USD 770.59/ha) and benefit-cost ratio (1.93), making it the most effective and profitable weed management strategy for dill cultivation.',

Although global data indicate that most dentists will encounter emergencies during their careers, little is known about preparedness in conflict-affected areas. In Syria, years of war have stretched health infrastructure to breaking point, likely leaving many dental clinics poorly equipped for acute crises. This study assesses how often Syrian dentists face such emergencies, their confidence in managing them, and the availability of essential equipment and medications to identify the most pressing training and resource needs. In March 2025, an anonymous, Delphi-based online survey (Cronbach's α = 0.87; n = 1,034) was conducted among general dentists, residents, and specialists practicing in Damascus and its surrounding rural areas. Five domains were covered: patient pre-assessment, medical resources and equipment, team training and readiness, emergency types and frequency, and conflict-related challenges. Responses were analyzed descriptively and inferentially. Of 1,821 invited practitioners, 1,034 completed the survey (56.8% response rate). Significant gaps were identified: 91.2% (n = 943) lacked written emergency plans, 61.8% (n = 639) had no basic emergency kits, and 85.4% (n = 883) lacked oxygen supplies; no clinic possessed an automated external defibrillator. Half of the staff (50.1% n = 518) had received no emergency-management training, and 70.7% (n = 731) rated university education as inadequate. Conflict-driven barriers were stark: 65.6% (n = 678) reported severe medicine shortages due to sanctions, 61.9% (n = 640) performed no regular equipment maintenance, and 44.1% (n = 456) faced disrupted training access. Syrian dental clinics face major preparedness shortfalls-including absence of emergency plans, critical equipment shortages, and insufficient training-exacerbated by war and sanctions. We recommend partnering with international organizations to secure supplies, implementing simplified emergency protocols with mandatory equipment checks, and linking clinic licensing to minimum preparedness standards. These recommendations are based on data from dentists in Damascus and its rural surroundings and may not fully generalize to other Syrian regions.",

    title: 'The determinants of self-care behaviors and calcium-vitamin D intake in elderly women: a comparative study of osteoporosis and healthy counterparts.',
    abstract: 'Effective management of osteoporosis requires individuals to take responsibility for following medication, exercise, and dietary guidelines. The aim of this study was to provide important insights into self-care behaviors and their determinants, especially dietary patterns related to vitamin D and calcium intake among elderly women, both healthy and those with osteoporosis. This cross-sectional descriptive-comparative study included 250 postmenopausal women aged 60 and above, consisting of 125 healthy women and 125 women with osteoporosis which conducted in Tabriz, Iran. The data collection instruments comprised a demographic questionnaire, Menopausal Self-Care Questionnaire, and Vitamin D and Calcium Food Frequency Questionnaire. Multivariate linear regression models were employed to identify predictors of self-care behaviors and dietary intakes. The mean (Standard deviation: SD) total self-care score (33-165) in healthy women was higher 118.97 ± 19.92 compared to osteoporotic women 84.7 ± 14.98 (p < 0.001). Healthy women also exhibited significantly higher daily dietary intakes of calcium (850.52 ± 147.92 mg vs. 546.71 ± 60.28 mg, p < 0.001) and vitamin D (3.38 ± 0.65 mg vs. 2.0 ± 0.34 mg, p < 0.001) than osteoporotic women. Multivariate analysis identified household income, age, education, exercise, and BMI as key predictors of self-care behaviors and dietary intakes (p < 0.05) in healthy and osteoporotic elderly women. Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis exhibited poorer self-care behaviors and lower calcium/vitamin D intake compared to healthy peers, with socioeconomic factors (income, education), exercise, age, and BMI as key predictors.',

    title: 'Barriers and solutions for the European prescribing exam: a qualitative world café study.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: To harmonize and modernize clinical pharmacology and therapeutics (CPT) education across Europe, we developed the European Prescribing Exam. Before its introduction into medical degree programs, it is crucial to understand the potential barriers to its implementation and ways to overcome them. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify barriers and potential solutions to the implementation of the European Prescribing Exam.\n' +
      'METHODS: This qualitative World Café (WC) study involved CPT teachers who participated in a 2-day event focused on the European Prescribing Exam. There were five tables in the WC, each dedicated to a different topic of implementation: (1) organization, (2) technical aspects, (3) content, (4) rollout logistics, and (5) politics. Participants rotated randomly between the tables every 20 min. During each round, they were encouraged to identify barriers and solutions, which were then discussed. The rounds continued until data saturation was reached. Findings were summarized at the end of the WC. We used inductive thematic analysis using a semantic approach to analyze the data.\n' +
      'RESULTS: In total, 26 CPT teachers (female: n = 14) from 19 medical schools in 15 European countries participated. After four rounds, 86 potential barriers and 86 solutions were identified. Most barriers were related to the topics "Content" (n = 22), "Organization" (n = 20), and "Technical aspects" (n = 18). Thematic analysis identified 11 themes, three of which were overarching, meaning they applied to multiple topics. The most significant themes included barriers related to curricula, motivation, information technology, and relevance.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This study shows that organizing and implementing the European Prescribing Exam will be challenging. However, participants proposed potential solutions for nearly all barriers, which suggest that the implementation of the European Prescribing Exam is feasible.',
