    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    summary: 'Blockchain’s spontaneous consensus mechanism, characterized by technologies of decentralization, immutability, high transparency, and codification, helps address agency costs and the formalization of shareholder meetings in traditional corporate governance. With the advancement of blockchain technology, the integration of legal rules and code rules in corporate governance has become the new norm. As per the transaction cost theory of law and economics and the Coase Theorem, blockchain has promoted changes in governance rules by markedly reducing agency costs within companies. Corporate governance will exhibit partial and gradual adjustments when blockchain technology substantially diminishes these costs but falls short of achieving the optimal state of zero transaction costs. These changes not only enhance the transparency and efficiency of corporate governance but also effectively curb the misconduct of controlling shareholders and protect the rights of minority shareholders.',

    summary: 'Although Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) presents vast opportunities and potential within the educational domain, the optimal integration of educational theory with GAI to enhance academic performance and problem-solving skills remains an area that requires further exploration. Therefore, this study aims to develop an integrating GAI with self-explanations scaffolding platform to enhance students’ learning performance and problem-solving skills through completing scaffolding tasks. Furthermore, this study evaluates students’ perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the system based on the Technology Acceptance Model. The findings indicate that students in the experimental group demonstrated a significant improvement in learning performance and problem-solving skills after utilizing the platform proposed by this study. Additionally, the experimental group exhibited positive technology acceptance toward the platform. Finally, results from the semi-structured interviews suggest that learning programming through the self-explanations scaffolding platform can mitigate learning setbacks, provide cognitive guidance, strengthen conceptual connections, facilitate knowledge construction, and enhance application skills.',

Topic modeling using BERTopic revealed that the experimental group's reflections focused more on strategy adjustment, logical reasoning, and conceptual understanding, whereas the control group's reflections were more descriptive and operational. These findings suggest that AI-supported structured feedback can enhance the quality of student reflections, increase learning engagement, and improve collaborative interactions. This study demonstrates the practical value and effectiveness of AI-assisted reflection within the 6E+R instructional model, offering new directions for reflective design in STEM collaborative learning and expanding the potential of generative AI in educational settings.",

    title: 'Non-Immersive Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) with XR Elements in Nursing Education: Learning Interaction and Clinical Competence',
    summary: 'The way nursing students acquire clinical competence and patient safety awareness has changed as a result of the adoption of virtual learning environments (VLEs) in healthcare education. Non-immersive VLEs that display virtual scenarios offer secure learning experiences. Easily accessible and reasonably priced non-immersive VLEs can safely enhance learning clinical procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no earlier research on non-immersive VLEs with extended reality (XR) elements in nursing education, and this research fills that gap. This study investigates nursing students’ expectations and experiences of using non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to learn interaction and clinical competence, such as infusion pump operations. It also explores the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the use of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements in this context. Fifteen first-year nursing students engaged in two non-immersive learning scenarios. The learning process was structured using a seven-phase simulation pedagogy. The data were collected using pre- and post-questionnaires; group discussions; and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings highlight the potential of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to enhance engagement, confidence, and competence acquisition in nursing students while complementing traditional hands-on training. The study highlights the importance of blended learning strategies that integrate technical and scenario-based approaches, as well as simulation pedagogy, to optimize knowledge retention and clinical competency development. As digital technologies continue to shape healthcare education, non-immersive VLEs with XR elements are valuable in bridging the gap between theory and practice, ultimately contributing to patient safety and improved healthcare outcomes.',

    summary: 'This study investigates the use of virtual reality (VR) as a pedagogical tool to foster English narrative competence and empathy among nursing students in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. Through a 16-week course-integrated intervention, 98 third-year nursing students in a five-year associate degree program at a junior nursing college participated in a co-creation project using CoSpaces Edu to collaboratively design immersive, first-person 3D narratives based on an end-of-life care scenario. The project aimed to develop students’ linguistic skills while promoting humanistic understanding through perspective-taking. Employing a mixed-methods design, the study incorporated pre- and post-intervention vocabulary tests, oral narrative evaluations, student reflections, and interviews. Results demonstrated significant gains in English vocabulary and narrative expression, increased oral confidence, and evidence of enhanced empathy as students adopted diverse character roles in their digital stories. The findings underscore the pedagogical affordances of VR-based co-creation in EFL instruction for healthcare students, revealing how immersive storytelling can bridge language learning with humanistic nursing education. Implications for XR-enhanced language education and interdisciplinary curriculum design are discussed.',

    title: 'From Peer Educators to Digital Change Agents: Rethinking Health Education Through VR-Enhanced Peer Learning',
    summary: 'The rapid digital transformation of healthcare necessitates new educational models that foster digital competence, innovation capacity, and student empowerment. This study explores the intersection of virtual reality (VR) and peer-assisted learning (PAL) in health professions education, presenting the development of the VR-PAL Innovation Model—a conceptual framework that integrates immersive simulation with student-led pedagogical leadership. Drawing on reflexive thematic analysis of focus group interviews with three cohorts of peer assistants (N = 10), the study identifies three interconnected components: a pedagogical foundation rooted in sociocultural learning theory, a structured train-the-trainer program cycle, and a set of innovation enablers, including inclusive design, co-creation, and the cultivation of a digital mindset. The findings highlight how peer educators, through their dual roles as learners and facilitators, emerge as digital change agents capable of driving innovation from within the learning environment. The model extends existing PAL frameworks by positioning students not only as knowledge sharers but also as agents of educational technology integration. While grounded in occupational therapy education, the VR-PAL model offers a transferable approach for institutions aiming to scale student-centered digital innovation. Implications for implementation, scalability, and future research are discussed.',

To help close the research gap, this study takes a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the usability of text-to-image generators in design processes. The results from the System Usability Scale and semi-structured interviews indicate that while design students perceive the overall usability of generative AI positively, they rate the functionality, system feedback and efficiency of these tools less favorably. In-depth analyses of interview results suggest that limited control, limited interpretability and inconsistency of results are barriers for the usability of generative AI in design education.',

    title: 'The Burden of Chronic Pain on Women: A Secondary Analysis of Data From the National Study on Disability (ENDISC) in Chile.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a prevalent condition that disproportionately affects women, significantly impairing their functioning. Understanding its prevalence and impact is essential for designing effective interventions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of chronic pain among women and assess its effects on functioning.\n' +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis utilised data from the National Study on Disability (ENDISC-2022) in Chile, focusing on women aged 18 years and older. Chronic pain was assessed through self-reported data, and functioning was evaluated using performance indicators derived from the Model Disability Survey (MDS). Generalised Linear Models (GLM) were applied to examine associations with sociodemographic and psychosocial variables, and stratified analyses compared women with and without chronic pain.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among the 30,010 participants in the ENDISC study, 14.8% reported chronic pain, with 67.1% of those affected being women. Women experiencing chronic pain exhibited significantly poorer performance scores across all evaluated domains compared to their counterparts without pain. The GLM regression analysis revealed that women with chronic pain had a significantly higher risk of worse functioning scores compared to those without chronic pain.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic factors such as age, education level, and employment status further influenced outcomes, underscoring the vulnerability of women with chronic pain. Chronic pain is a significant and pervasive issue among women in Chile, markedly impairing their functioning and well-being. Gender-sensitive approaches and policies are crucial to reducing the burden of chronic pain and improving the quality of life for affected women, particularly those in vulnerable sociodemographic groups.\n' +
      'SIGNIFICANCE: The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions that address the multifaceted nature of chronic pain, including its physical, psychological, and social dimensions in women with pain and a more sensitive look at the difficulties encountered by this population, such as work issues.',

    title: 'The Mental Health and Well-Being of Adults With Intellectual Disabilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic Across the UK: A Four-Wave Longitudinal Analysis.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Research concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of adults with intellectual disabilities has been cross-sectional and small scale. We examined the trajectory of mental health and well-being across the pandemic period across the UK and the factors which predicted different mental health trajectories.\n' +
      'METHOD: Adults with intellectual disabilities participated in co-designed structured interviews. Four waves of data were collected between December 2020 and late 2022. At Wave 1, 621 adults with intellectual disabilities participated, with 355 at Wave 4. Well-being, pandemic anxiety, depression, anxiety, anger and loneliness outcomes were measured. Latent class mixed modelling was used to identify subgroups and within-group trajectories.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Well-being and pandemic anxiety remained relatively stable across time, but levels of anger, depression, anxiety and loneliness reduced gradually over time. Overall patterns masked trajectory subgroups, with differences in intercept and steepness of decline or increase in mental health problems. Different factors were generally influential for trajectory class membership and overall change across time for outcomes. Leaving the house for exercise or green spaces reported increasing well-being and reduced loneliness. Similarly, those working, volunteering or in education at Wave 1 were found to have increasing well-being and reduced loneliness, sadness and worry, and increasing wellbeing and reducing anger if they were working pre-pandemic.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Social connection and engagement in purposeful activity were vital to maintaining the mental health and well-being of people with intellectual disabilities. Factors that were found to reduce mental well-being during the pandemic should be considered in planning for future major public health challenges and in promoting better mental well-being for people with intellectual disabilities in everyday life.',

    title: 'Providing gender sensitive mental health care to address the specific needs of women.',
    abstract: "There has been a renewed focus on improving mental health outcomes and experiences for women with the publication of 'Embedding Women's Mental Health in Sharing the Vision', but much needs to be done to translate this policy into tangible improvements in delivered care. Historical biases in medical education and practice, as well as in research, have led to serious deficiencies in how illnesses are diagnosed and managed in women. This is not solely observed in mental health, and andronormative perspectives and gender blindness are widespread throughout medicine. Trauma informed practices should be adopted in all healthcare settings that treat women. Consideration also needs to be given to reproductive life stage in psychotropic prescribing beyond concerns of the risk of teratogenicity. Medical education and training should play a central role in increasing gender awareness among healthcare professionals. Combining top-down policy initiatives with bottom-up education and training is required to meaningfully integrate gender awareness into mental healthcare and address historical shortcomings in care for women. Implementing gender-sensitive practices is an important step toward delivering more individualised, patient-centred mental health services.",

    title: 'The role of inflammation, chronic pain, and hypertension on cognitive functioning in an underserved, rural population: a Project FRONTIER study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Inflammation, chronic pain, and hypertension have been identified as risk factors for cognitive decline; few studies have examined the interplay between multiple risk factors and even fewer have considered these factors in underserved rural populations.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the relationships between inflammation, chronic pain, and hypertension with cognitive functioning in an underserved, primarily Hispanic, rural population from Project FRONTIER (Facing Rural Obstacles to Healthcare Now Through Intervention, Education, & Research).\n' +
      'METHODS: This epidemiological study enrolled 1,864 participants (M = 59.68 years, SD = 12.21) living in five rural counties in West Texas. Consented participants disclosed medical diagnoses (e.g. chronic pain), completed five cognitive evaluations (i.e. the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Trails Making Test A and B, and Clock Drawing 1 and 2), and attended a medical examination during which a physician confirmed existing medical conditions (e.g. hypertension) and collected a blood sample for further analysis (e.g. inflammation markers).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Analysis via MANOVA revealed a multivariate effect of inflammation (V = .02, F(4, 969) = 3.72,  = .006) and a multivariate effect of hypertension (V = .03, F(4, 969) = 6.69,  < .001). There was no multivariate effect for chronic pain (V = .01, F(4,969) = 2.18,  = .07) and no significant two way or three way interaction. Post-hoc ANOVAs further illustrated the relationships between specific cognitive functioning domains and inflammation or hypertension.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The current study findings suggest that underserved rural populations have unique epidemiological experiences that are distinct from prior findings in urban populations. Inflammation and hypertension are important clinical considerations as risk factors for cognitive decline. Future research should explore interventions that support rural-dwelling individuals impacted by provider shortages.',

    title: 'Reviews in Educational Psychology (Frontiers in Psychology 2010-2024): typology, topics, regional comparative and methodology toward digital and AI approaches.',
    abstract: 'This study presents a systematic review of reviews published in Frontiers in Psychology (2010-2024) to examine methodological and conceptual advances in educational psychology. The objective is to synthesize research trends over 14 years and explore global challenges, such as the digitalization of education and the integration of emerging technologies. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in Frontiers in Psychology, Web of Science, and Scopus, identifying 392 reviews. The selection process involved duplicate removal, title and abstract screening, and full-text evaluation, applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure methodological rigor. Data extraction and classification were carried out using an Excel-based structured database, analyzing publication years, methodological design, data sources, statistical and qualitative analysis methods, validation approaches, theoretical frameworks, thematic areas, geographical distribution, study limitations, reported results, practical applications and study populations. The methodological analysis highlights the predominance of systematic reviews, the increasing adoption of qualitative and mixed-method approaches, and a growing emphasis on digital tools and artificial intelligence. The study also reveals significant regional disparities in research output, with some regions being notably underrepresented. Beyond identifying trends, this review of reviews illustrates how psychology adapts to contemporary educational challenges through interdisciplinary methodologies and evidence-based strategies. The findings provide valuable insights into the evolving challenges in educational psychology, reinforcing the role of Frontiers in Psychology in driving methodological innovation and scholarly discourse. Furthermore, they contribute to the advancement of inclusive and sustainable educational practices aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Future research should focus on meta-analyses of emerging trends, longitudinal methodological studies, and strategies to address regional imbalances, fostering a more globally representative perspective.',

    title: 'Gender Differences for the Associations among Housework, Self-Stigma, and Psychiatric Symptoms among Community Severe Mental Disorder Patients.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Previous studies have suggested housework might reduce self-stigma and psychiatric symptoms, but it had not been validated in severe mental illness (SMI) patients. Considering gender differences, we examined the relationship between housework, self-stigma, and psychiatric symptoms to link family, social, and disease factors, aiding rehabilitation from a "life-oriented" perspective, promoting patients from "passive treatment" to "active life reconstruction".\n' +
      'PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 486 questionnaires from SMI patients in Shandong, China (210 men, 276 women, 124 in 0-40 age group, 244 in 41-64 age group, and 118 in 65 or older age group). Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Self-Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness 8-item version were used to measure psychiatric symptoms and self-stigma. Housework and demographic-variables were collected through a questionnaire complied by our research group. Linear regression explicit the relationship between the study variables, based on which a mediation analysis is established to verify the internal mechanism which controls confounding variables (age, religion, marriage, education, occupation, labor capacity, living alone, liability, chronic disease, disease status).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Most participants did housework for less than 1 hour, with men more likely than women (76.2% vs 56.2%). Housework reduced psychiatric symptoms in both genders (men: β = -5.563 (95% CI = -9.513, -1.613),  <0.01, and women: β = -4.088 (95% CI = -7.706, -0.469),  <0.01). However, housework only lowered self-stigma in women (β = -2.322 (95% CI = -3.922, -0.723),  <0.01). Self-stigma fully mediated the housework and psychiatric symptoms (indirect effect = -2.228, 95% CI = -4.046, -0.716).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Housework alleviated psychiatric symptoms in both genders, but only reduced the self-stigma of disease in women, suggesting its potential as a modifiable rehabilitation intervention.\n' +
      'LIMITATION: The cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences, self-reported data may introduce recall bias, the Shandong-based sample limits generalizability, unmeasured confounders (eg, medications, comorbidities) warrant further study, and the small sample size may reduce statistical power.',

    abstract: 'The Upper and Lower Airways Northern European Consensus (ULANC) and the European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airways diseases (EUFOREA) organized their first workshop in Copenhagen in January 2024. The aim of the " was to bring the concept of the global airway to the front line of medical care. ULANC is a multidisciplinary European consortium, that aims to improve the management of comorbid ear, nose and throat (ENT) conditions, such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), in patients also suffering from asthma. EUFOREA is an international non-profit organization forming an alliance of all stakeholders dedicated to reducing the prevalence and burden of chronic respiratory diseases through the implementation of optimal patient care via educational, research, and advocacy activities. The inclusive and multidisciplinary approach of ULANC and EUFOREA was reflected in the keynote lectures and workshop faculty coming from the allergology, pulmonology, ENT, and primary health care fields around the central theme of global airway diseases. The current report aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the key statements by the faculty of the "Primary care physicians and nurses with interest in Global Airway Diseases 2024", allowing all stakeholders in the respiratory field to be up-dated and ready to join forces in Europe and beyond.',

    title: 'Do dietary habits and iron-folic acid intake make a difference? Factors associated with anemia in pregnancy: a multi-center cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Anemia in pregnancy impacts the well-being of the women and the conception. Anemia is associated with increased risks of maternal mortality. In Ethiopia, three in ten pregnant women were affected by either mild, moderate, or severe anemia. The recent evidence was limited in the study locations of southern Ethiopia and needs to be updated. No report of anemia as relation to dietary factors observed in the region. This study therefore aimed to assess factors associated with anemia in pregnancy in the region.\n' +
      'METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2 to 30, 2025, in five selected public health facilities in Arba Minch district, South Ethiopia.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 476 (96%) respondents had participated in the survey. Explanatory variables were modeled in logistic regression to test for statistical associations at a  value of <0.05. The study participants were in the age range of 18 to 40 years. Of the respondents who completed the survey, 103 (21.6%, 95%CI 18.2-25.6%) were diagnosed as anemic. Participants who received iron-folic acid during the current pregnancy were 66% less likely to be anemic, AOR (95% CI), 0.34 (0.19, 0.61). Participants with high education status, sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN), not being infected with malaria in the current pregnancy, and age category between 20-29 years were less likely to experience anemia in pregnancy. Evidence was limited to support association of women dietary diversity score (WDDS) and anemia in pregnancy, AOR (95%CI), 0.83 (0.49, 1.40).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Anemia prevalence was a moderate public health problem in the study area. Healthcare workers should encourage antenatal women to receive iron and sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) for anemia protection during pregnancy.',

    title: 'Antenatal preparation as care: birth stories and collective learning at work.',
    abstract: 'Distressing and harmful birth experiences are the norm even in well-resourced countries, and conventional antenatal education struggles to adequately prepare birthing people. Drawing on previous research in support of participant-led antenatal education, a recent UK-based ethnographic study asks how birthing people use collective practices to produce birth knowledge. Data comes from participant observation at 24 antenatal sessions ( = 201) including conventional classes and community-based groups, plus 5 interviews with session leaders. The researcher analysed data using a novel application of template analysis, framed by feminist technoscience, ethnography and socio-narratology. Findings show how group-led sessions, storytelling and other collective knowledge practices  of birthing people. Several facets of care emerge from this inquiry, such as materiality, emotionality, working athwart dominant narratives and creating "care-full" absences or spaces. Excerpts from antenatal preparation sessions specifically demonstrate various approaches to knowledge working - and caring - in practice. A focus on real-life examples and implications ensures findings are useful and relevant for birthing women, midwives, antenatal educators, institutions, policymakers and more.',

    title: 'Construction and validation of a nomogram model for cognitive impairment in heart failure patients.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure face a significantly elevated risk of cognitive impairment, yet clinical recognition remains inadequate-particularly among younger individuals and those with mild symptoms, leading to frequent underdiagnosis. The increasing prevalence among younger patients further worsens prognosis. This study aims to develop a tool to aid clinicians in the early identification of high-risk individuals and support informed clinical decision-making.\n' +
      'METHODS: Based on evidence-based literature and biopsychosocial holistic model of cardiovascular health, this study included 320 patients with heart failure hospitalized in the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University from October 2023 to April 2024 to construct the model, and 80 patients from May to July 2024 were selected for temporal validation. MoCA was used to evaluate cognitive function. LASSO regression was used to select variables, Logistic regression was used to construct a nomogram model, and Bootstrap method (1,000 times) was used to evaluate the discrimination, calibration and clinical applicability of the model.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The incidence of cognitive impairment was 68.75% in the model group and 56.25% in the validation group. Finally, five variables including age, education level, coronary heart disease, cardiac diastolic function and physical frailty were included. The AUC of internal and temporal validation of the model were 80.2% and 72.44%, respectively, which had good prediction performance.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The calibration curve and decision curve of the model showed a high degree of fit, which had strong clinical practicability. This model provides a reliable tool for early identification of cognitive impairment in patients with heart failure.',
