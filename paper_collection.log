    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'Mothers’ duties and rights when positioned as remote education tutors in Australian distance schooling',
    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Public management of digitalization into the Spanish tourism services: a heterodox analysis',
    summary: "This study is a critical review of public intervention and its management of change with digitalization, applied to Spanish tourism services, as ones of the largest case and most required of attention into the European Union. In comparison with other mainstream papers, this heterodox review is based on the combination of Austrian Economics and Neo-Institutional approaches ( Cornucopists ), with their common theoretical and methodological frameworks. Thus, it is possible to analyze failures and paradoxes in the public intervention, especially with post-COVID recovery policies. The case of the Spanish tourism sector highlights the effect of double bureaucracy, from European institutions and the Spanish Government, affecting its competitiveness and revealing the confirmation of heterodox theorems. Faced with mainstream public intervention guidelines, which usually involve expansive spending and more debt (and New-Malthusian measures), a heterodox mainline solution is offered here, based on the revival of the original sustainability principle, the readjustment effect and the promotion of geek'n'talent education, to facilitate the transition to the Knowledge Economy, where the tourism sector is capable of offering personalized travel experiences due to digitalization.",

    title: 'In pursuit of equity in upper secondary education: the curious case of Ghana’s free senior high school policy',
    summary: 'The Free Senior High School policy is Ghana’s attempt at actualising the SDG 4 global consensus on free upper secondary education. Using grounded theory method, this research scrutinises the Free SHS 2018 policy and strategy document, alongside interviews with policymakers, to answer the question: How does the equity provision ensure fairness in upper secondary education, and what equity blind spots exist? Specifically, the study employed a purposive sampling technique, allowing for the deliberate selection of data sources that ensured the collection of focused, meaningful data aligned with the research goals. The findings underscore a disconnect between the policy’s equity intentions and solutions. For example, the policy highlights that, intersectional differences—such as economic, school-based, gender, and regional factors—persist and drive inequitable access. However, these issues are inadequately addressed because the policy applies cookie-cutter-style economic solutions to all inequity concerns. Policymakers from within, and outside from government, hold diverse perspectives on the impact of this disconnect on sub-populations. The former underscores political and technical accountabilities where increasing numbers of enrolment are equated to equity, while the latter underscores differential policy effect sizes on sub-population to mean inequity. Curiously, the policy has improved access despite the equity conundrum, weak economy, lack of private–public initiatives, declining GDP allocation to education, no selective fee waivers, and neglect of secondary education expansion prerequisites. The paper advocates realigning the policy’s equity dimension with its equity goals.',

    title: 'A phenomenological reading of integration in the longitudinal integrated clerkship',
    summary: 'This paper reports on a phenomenological reading of integration in education programs, through three layers of specificity: (1) broadly, on integration as an educational idea; (2) more particularly, on integration as expressed in the program model of the longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC); and (3) with the highest degree of specificity, on integration ‘at work’ in an actual LIC program. Each layer of penetration found different aspects of the phenomenological nature of integration. A further integrative leap across these aspects phenomenologically revealed four essential qualities of integration, being: integration transforms parts into wholes; integration’s animating locus is mutable, mobile and multiple; integration is already at work and is sustained through possibility; and integration holds open for ‘more’ integration. By appreciating integration for its essential qualities, this research adds foundational value to the literature on educational integration, and opens new questions about how we, as educators, might deliberately work with both its presence and its promise in our educational pedagogies, practices and programs.',

    title: 'The positioning of quality and expertise in initial teacher education: policy enactment in the Australian context',
    summary: 'Teacher quality and teacher education improvement have been central discourses for at least two decades in global education. In Australia, despite the pervasive nature of these discussions, there is a lack of substantial evidence indicating the existence of a problem in this regard. Policies aimed at enhancing the ‘preparedness’ of teacher graduates and elevating the ‘quality’ of ITE programs have nonetheless emerged as prevalent solutions over the past decade. The latest enactment of reforms in the policy chain is the Strong Beginnings report from the Teacher Education Expert Panel. In this paper, we align with Ball’s perspective that policy should be viewed as a dynamic process rather than a presumed, ready-made solution to a problem. We utilise systematic conceptual coding using Leximancer to enable a nuanced exploration of the understandings, practices, and conditions of influence for the policy actors inscribed in the TEEP report. We also analyse concept frequency and collocation in the final Strong Beginnings report, noting two main propositions: first, that there is a problem with quality in ITE; and second, that practice is foregrounded in professionalisation. We highlight the consistencies and contradictions within the discourses of the final report and the submissions from policy actors that contributed to this policy enactment process. We suggest that evidence is used when it suits a policy position, but ignored if it disrupts the platform position. We conclude by arguing that the policy actors in this policy enactment process should be afforded the professional authority to continue a well-established process of continual improvement.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    summary: 'In this paper, we suggest that poetic inquiry offers a pathway for capturing the deeply felt, personal dimensions of ongoing identity growth of initial teacher educators of professional experience. We propose that poetic inquiry provides an avenue for authentically sharing experiences and insights into caring and being cared for, diverging from conventional academic narratives. Through poetic self-reflection and collective poetic representation, we can uncover and navigate the subtle tensions shaping our identity journey, fostering a communal understanding of the teacher educator’s role within the contexts of Australian higher education and initial teacher education.',

    title: 'Digital redesign of the radiotherapy course for medical students with a blended learning approach',
    summary: 'Purpose Due to the need for high-quality teaching, we present a new blended learning concept combining digital modules, interactive seminars, and clinical experience. Furthermore, we evaluated its acceptance among students. Methods A new concept for teaching was applied to the radiotherapy module and made available via the Hannover Medical School (MHH) learning management system as part of a blended learning concept with educational films, multimedia learning modules, online seminars, and onsite practical training. The evaluation recorded assessments of the requirement profile, design, and opportunities for skills acquisition; evaluation of the seminar and internship; and questions on the overall assessment. Results The new concept was applied to four passes in the fourth academic year. A total of 152 students completed the radio-oncology learning module, which was evaluated by 46 students. Forty students considered the course duration to be appropriate for the material covered, and most students stated that their prior knowledge had been sufficient. The level of difficulty of the content was rated by the students as somewhat too high. The design of the digital course, the opportunity to acquire skills, the seminar course, and the practical course were mostly rated positively. Conclusion Through digital redesign, a teaching concept can be implemented that combines self-determined learning, professional exchange with doctors, and clinical practice experience. The concept can be transferred to other areas because it combines theoretical knowledge transfer with synchronous teaching and clinical experience. The results of the evaluation show that the students rated the new concept well.',

    title: 'Associations of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep patterns with cognitive function among middle-aged and older adults.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Despite the established evidence that physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep affect cognitive function individually, less is known about the combined effects of these movement behaviors. The study aimed to identify movement patterns of physical activity, sitting time, and sleep and to examine the association of movement patterns with cognitive function.\n' +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1,240 participants aged ≥ 55 years participating in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study who visited the Cooper Clinic, Dallas (2016-2019) for preventive health care. Four movement behaviors were self-reported, including leisure-time aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity, sitting time, sleep, and other characteristics. Cognitive function was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Four categorical indicators were created for each movement behavior and used to identify latent classes. Information criterion, scaled relative entropy and model interpretability were used to determine the optimal number of classes. Participants were assigned to the predicted classes based on their highest posterior probabilities. Multinomial regressions examined the association between movement patterns and each covariate. Linear and logistic regression models examined the association of movement patterns and cognitive function. A sensitivity analysis accounted for misclassification errors.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Participants were predominantly White (95%), male (71%), with an average age of 62 years. A 3-class model was selected, comprising class 1: active long sleepers, class 2: very active short sleepers, and class 3: moderately active short sleepers, representing 11%, 62%, and 27% of the sample. Compared to class 2, class 1 was more likely to be older and female, while class 3 was more likely to be female, have less education, be overweight and obese, and have chronic conditions. Compared to class 2, class 3 was associated with a lower MoCA total score, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. There were no differences in MoCA total score between class 2 and class 3 when further controlling for health behaviors and indicators. Sensitivity analysis accounting for misclassification suggested that class 3 had a significantly lower average MoCA total score than class 2.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The current study identified three distinct movement classes that exhibited different sociodemographic, health characteristics and cognitive functions. Findings highlight that less active, more sedentary, and shorter sleep individuals had worse cognitive function.',

    title: 'The social determinants of tuberculosis: a case-control study characterising pathways to equitable intervention in Peru.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Despite being key components of global tuberculosis policy, poverty reduction and social protection interventions have been inconsistently implemented. We aimed to characterise how poverty and interrelated personal risk factors increase tuberculosis risk in Peru to inform the design of locally appropriate, person-centred, equity-oriented interventions.\n' +
      'METHODS: We undertook a case-control study among people aged 15 years and over in 32 communities in Peru between 2016 and 2019. Cases (n = 2337) were people diagnosed with any form of tuberculosis. Controls (n = 981) were people living in randomly selected households in the same communities. We derived measures of household poverty from three dimensions (physical, human, and financial capital) and investigated the associations between these; personal risk factors more specifically linked to health (e.g. smoking); and tuberculosis. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and population attributable fractions (PAF). A directed acyclic graph was used to inform the analytical approach.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Household poverty was strongly associated with tuberculosis (aOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 2.3-4.2 for people from the 'poorer' versus 'less poor' half of households). There was a non-linear social gradient across deciles of household poverty, with odds of tuberculosis increasing exponentially as poverty deepened (aOR = 12.6; 95% CI: 6.8-23.2 for the 'poorest' decile versus the 'least poor' decile). Overall, tuberculosis burden could be halved by reducing poverty in the 'poorer' half of households to the level of the 'less poor' half (PAF = 47%; 95% CI: 40-54). For key personal risk factors, we estimated PAF for alcohol excess (PAF = 12.3%, 95% CI: 7.2-17.2); underweight (PAF = 10.3%, 95% CI: 8.7-11.8); smoking (PAF = 8.8%, 95% CI: 3.8-13.5); HIV (PAF = 5.7%, 95% CI: 4.6-6.7); and diabetes (PAF = 4.6%, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0). We also identified other important risk factors including previous tuberculosis (PAF = 14.8%, 95% CI: 11.6-17.9); incarceration (PAF = 9.5%, 95% CI: 6.8-12.1); and lower social capital (PAF = 4.1%, 95% CI: 2.6-5.6). Most personal risk factors, particularly education and substance misuse, tuberculosis exposures (e.g. incarceration and homelessness), and undernutrition, exhibited a social gradient across quintiles of household poverty and were more prevalent in people living in poorer households (Cochran-Armitage test for linear trend P < 0.001 for variables showing these social gradients).\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Interventions addressing multidimensional household poverty and interrelated personal risk factors could substantially reduce tuberculosis burden. Our results provide an evidence base for designing person-centred, equity-oriented interventions; and support more effective implementation of poverty reduction and social protection within the global tuberculosis response.',

    title: `"We're all in it together": uniting a diverse range of professionals and people with lived experience within the development of a complex, theory-based paediatric speech and language therapy intervention.`,
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: It is increasingly commonplace to involve relevant professionals and people with lived experience within healthcare research. Although valuable case studies regarding such involvement exist, there is currently a paucity of case studies highlighting the professional and personal impacts of uniting a diverse group of professionals and people with lived experience within the development of new, theory-based interventions. The aim of this paper is to provide insight into the impacts of involving a diverse range of individuals, unified within a single steering group, within the development of a new, theory-based, paediatric speech and language therapy intervention ("Supporting Words and Sounds" - SWanS). By describing the involvement process in detail and providing our personal insights, we hope our recommendations will be of use to future healthcare researchers.\n' +
      'MAIN BODY: Our project steering group consists of two people with lived experience (an adult with Developmental Language Disorder-DLD, a parent of a child with DLD), three specialist NHS speech and language therapists (including one university lecturer with equality and diversity expertise), and two individuals working in the education sector (a specialist teacher and a bilingual educational support worker). Group members have been involved across the 4 phase intervention development process. Tools such as the PiiAF (Public involvement impact Assessment Framework) have guided our personal and professional reflections on our individual experiences of being in a diverse steering group responsible for developing a new and complex theory-based intervention.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: We found that having a diverse range of people unified in a singular intervention development steering group had unexpected benefits. Learning from each other has enriched professional practice and developed individuals' confidence in terms of playing an active role in research. Our structured reflection has implications for future intervention development research, by highlighting that the provision of a safe, supportive space and nurturing of shared values is key when involving a diverse range of parties. Such contexts promote sustained involvement and therefore have longer term implications for increasing the relevance of the research for those it is aiming to help.",

    title: "Medical students' attitudes toward providing patients with audio recordings of their medical encounters: a cross-sectional online survey.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Medical encounters often involve complex information that can be challenging to process, especially in emotionally charged situations. Providing patients with audio recordings of their medical encounters, termed consultation recordings, has shown promising benefits such as improved information recall and understanding. In prior research, patients largely reported favorable attitudes toward consultation recordings; physicians were more skeptical, particularly regarding legal risks. To date, consultation recordings are rare in Germany. This study aimed at understanding medical students' attitudes toward consultation recordings, as they are the healthcare professionals of the future and could therewith play a crucial role in further implementation efforts.\n" +
      'METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional quantitative online survey with medical students in Germany, assessing attitudes toward and desire for future consultation recordings. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two participants were included. 56% of participants expressed positive attitudes toward consultation recordings, acknowledging benefits such as information recall and preparation for follow-up consultations. However, they also expressed significant concerns about potential misuse, legal implications, and physicians feeling pressured. About 16% of participants expressed a clear willingness to offer consultation recordings in the future, while 44% were hesitant.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our findings that medical students recognize potential benefits of consultation recordings, while simultaneously expressing concerns about this intervention, are comparable to results from studies conducted in physician samples. Medical students' limited clinical experience and the low prevalence of consultation recordings in Germany likely contribute to these apprehensions. These mixed attitudes could be addressed by providing opportunities for positive experiences with consultation recordings during medical and postgraduate education as well as in clinical practice. Providing role models who support patient-centered care could also foster greater acceptance. Future research should focus on the integration of patient-centered interventions such as consultation recordings in the medical curricula. Overall, consultation recordings have the potential to become a valuable tool in routine healthcare if current barriers are effectively addressed.",

    title: 'Understanding sexual and reproductive health need of unmarried adolescents and youth in urban slums: evidence from a formative study in Uttar Pradesh, India.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Despite the intentional focus of national programs and strategies in last decade, unmarried adolescents and youth (AY) face multiple challenges related to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information, and access to health and counseling services. With massive urbanization and growing slum and more focus on married youth, the situation and need of unmarried AY are often overlooked. The present study explores the SRH need of AY to gain a holistic understanding of the SRH landscape in the context of slums of Uttar Pradesh, India.\n' +
      'METHODS: A formative qualitative study was conducted in the slums of two cities in Uttar Pradesh using qualitative research techniques-in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with unmarried adolescents and youths aged 15-24 years. Thematic analysis was guided by principles of grounded theory and narrative inquiry, both inductive and deductive approaches.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The study found limited awareness of SRH issues and often inaccurate knowledge of modern contraceptives among the unmarried youth.Gendered access to SRH information emerged clearly, with boys benefitting from wider peer network, while girls relied on familial networks. Lack of social networks and support, communication gap, and limited reach of health providers have majorly contributed to misinformation and misconceptions. Information through social media and online sources served as a key source of SRH knowledge among adolescents and unmarried youth, but concerns remained about the accuracy and reliability of the information accessed. Structural constraints such as stigma, mobility restrictions, and provider bias further marginalized unmarried youth-especially girls-from accessing reliable SRH services.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The study highlighted demand for SRH knowledge, source of knowledge, major concerns, and opportunities of AY in urban slums. A clear need for multi-faceted strategies targeting sexual health education, adolescent-responsive SRH services, and expanded digital outreach with verified content for this vulnerable populations are identified. However, targeted intervention through system level approaches for AY can be helpful for dispelling myths and providing accurate information.',

    title: 'Verifying learning success: assessment and certification of student ultrasound education.',
    abstract: 'Student ultrasound education (SUSE) is currently composed of heterogeneous curricular training formats, and new approaches are continually being explored to enhance undergraduate ultrasound training. Based on a literature review, this report aims to analyze and compare different forms and methods of assessment of acquired skills in ultrasound training. Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of assessment formats and certification systems used in SUSE were discussed collaboratively between medical students, postgraduate physicians, and medical didactics experts. Ultrasound competency should be tested using structured examination formats that are objective and standardized. In addition to cognitive skills, the examination format should cover translational and behavioral components. Self-assessments and evaluations provide additional valuable perspectives. Certification systems can contribute to quality assurance by externally ensuring the achievement of milestones in SUSE. They also have the potential to support the necessary standardization of undergraduate ultrasound teaching by aligning the curricular learning objectives with qualifications to be achieved.',

    title: 'Gender-related factors affecting community malaria-related perceptions and practices in Migori County, Kenya.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Malaria poses a significant global public health challenge yet there remains limited information on the influence of gender dynamics on malaria programmes despite the well-known gender-specific differentials in the prevalence, transmission and exposure to malaria. The 2024 World Malaria Report indicates that the burden of malaria and the challenges in addressing it remain severe in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with eleven countries including Kenya bearing almost two-thirds of the global disease burden. Kenya remains heavily affected, with around 70% of the population at risk. The aim of this paper is to explore how gender-related factors influence malaria healthcare-seeking perceptions and practices in Migori County, a malaria endemic area in Western Kenya.\n' +
      'METHODS: The study employed a qualitative research design to gain in-depth insights into local perceptions and practices regarding malaria. Thirty-one in-depth interviews, four gender-stratified focus group discussions, six key informant interviews, and five process mapping exercises. Participants were purposively selected to ensure diversity and data thematically with both inductive and deductive approaches applied to generate themes.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The results of the study are in three main themes; gender-related similarities and differences in malaria healthcare-seeking perceptions; gender differentials in malaria prevention and treatment practices and the gendered dimensions of malaria healthcare-seeking information. Participants were generally aware of malaria, although there were noticeable gaps in their understanding regarding transmission and prevention. Gender related factors including gender dimensions (gender roles and relations); social stratifiers (level of education, gender identity, occupation) and cultural dynamics (beliefs- religion and traditional superstitions) influenced the perceptions of risk and vulnerability. Decision-making was reported as shared in relation to type of treatment and access to care.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: The study of community's perceptions reveals that malaria healthcare-seeking, knowledge, attitudes and practices and the perceptions of risk and vulnerability are influenced by gender roles and relations and intersections among socio-demographic factors, beliefs including religion and traditional superstitions, and occupation. Gender disparities in knowledge and healthcare-seeking behaviours illuminated in this study underscore the need for gender-sensitive public health interventions, inclusive health policies and integration of pluralistic health care systems to improve public health outcomes.",

    title: 'Randomized controlled trial of asynchronous vs. synchronous online teaching formats: equal knowledge after training, greater acceptance and lower intrinsic motivation through asynchronous online learning.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: The growing importance of online education in recent years has led to an increased focus on implementing and optimizing online learning formats. This study investigated how a lecture delivered in an asynchronous or synchronous online teaching format affects acceptance, intrinsic motivation and knowledge levels after training. The results can be used to optimize online education by identifying format-specific advantages and adapting them to learners' needs.\n" +
      'METHODS: All the Styrian paramedics (N = 5910) were invited to participate in the study and randomly assigned to one of two groups. A total of 1044 participants completed the trial, with one group receiving asynchronous training via a learning platform (N = 545) and the other group participating in synchronous training via webinars (N = 499) providing the same content. After completing a two-hour psychiatric emergency course, the participants were invited to complete a multiple-choice test and a survey assessing acceptance, preferences and intrinsic motivation. Linear regression, t tests and mediation analyses were conducted.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The asynchronous training format was significantly more accepted (p <.001) and preferred overall. The participants' preferences depended significantly on the type of learning format (p <.001). The synchronous learning format fostered greater intrinsic motivation (p =.001) and greater perceived autonomy (p <.001) but also a higher level of perceived pressure/tension (p =.003). The analysis revealed no significant difference in test results (p =.449) or perceived competence between the groups (p =.420). Furthermore, the difference in intrinsic motivation was fully mediated by perceived autonomy.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: There are different advantages and disadvantages to providing a lecture via webinar or online learning platform. Both formats are equally effective in terms of knowledge levels after training, highlighting the importance of adapting teaching strategies to learners' preferences.",

    title: 'Assessing decision-making skills with the Script Concordance Test (SCT) in clinical neurology and emergency medicine.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Clinical reasoning is an essential medical competence that should be taught and assessed from the beginning of medical studies. These skills can be evaluated using the Script Concordance Test (SCT), which presents daily clinical scenarios characterised by uncertainty. Due to the lack of validated research on this method in Germany, particularly in the field of neurology, we developed and implemented an SCT at Ruhr University Bochum. We compared different teaching methods (clinical seminar vs. digital video course) and their outcomes on the examination.\n' +
      'METHODS: A group of 6th-year medical students who had received the same education completed an SCT after participating in either a clinical seminar or a digital video course. The SCT was developed using blueprints on stroke and epilepsy. The test consisted of 40 case vignettes with a total of 120 items. Initially, experts completed the test to establish the reference panel. The final high-stakes examination was created using the aggregate scoring method and an item analysis.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The SCT was completed by 15 experts and 59 students. The final SCT consisted of 112 items and achieved a Cronbach's alpha of 0.85. A significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed between the experts, who achieved a mean score of 81.75, and the students on the first assessment day, who achieved a mean score of 68.92. No significant differences were found between the groups (interactive video course and seminar) or assessment time points. The questionnaire revealed a sense of insecurity in clinical decision-making before the SCT and highlighted the need to incorporate clinical reasoning practices from the beginning of medical studies to mitigate fear in uncertain situations. The SCT helped students structure decision-making processes and and improved their confidence in making decisions.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: The SCT is a reliable and valid tool for assessing medical students throughout their university education. Regular exposure to the SCT format would facilitate familiarity with its structure. We propose utilising the SCT as a learning tool rather than solely for assessment purposes. For instance, it could be integrated into teaching methodologies as a think-aloud exercise or incorporated into progress tests.',
