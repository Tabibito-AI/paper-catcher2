    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'The Future of Accounting Education Under the Developments in AI',
    summary: 'The development of science depends on the basics and principles of Science and scientific research in this science or field, and due to the fact that the nature of the science and field of accounting is developing and improving continuously and rapidly associated with many relationships and fields under many variables and factors, and then this research deals with difficulties between the three variables represented in scientific research, accounting education, and AI, specifically under of the widespread reliance on the preparation and preparation of scientific research using many advanced methods of AI, and then increasing the connection between and the development provided by scientific research. Accounting science and what is repeated in different formats follow the methods of AI. The research also aims to clarify the relationship between AI, accounting education, and accounting scientific research by conducting a questionnaire on a sample of 84 university professors and researchers in the field of accounting. The statistical analysis of the data collected by applying SPSS 25. It was concluded that the relationship between the three variables is considered close and interconnected. Without the first (accounting education), the development of the second (accounting scientific research) stops, which is considered inappropriate for the current business environment in all its categories, whether teaching or learning. Both scientific research and accounting education depend on the latter (AI) to provide technical and analytical support and classify opinions to reduce repetition and avoid deficiencies in the feasibility of research in accounting education.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'ChatGPT and University Students: How Family Education and Disciplinary Fields of Study Matter?',
    summary: 'Advanced AI models, like ChatGPT, offer significant innovation potential in higher education. Their ability to adapt learning to users’ individual needs results in improvements in performance, engagement and self-efficacy contributing to a deeper understanding of the topics covered. The use of chatbots in learning is pushing the scientific community to examine the potential and also the relative risks of these tools. This study aims to preliminarily investigate the level of knowledge and propensity to use ChatGPT to understand the key factors influencing the adoption of these tools among university students. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to over 300 students at the University of Salerno (Italy), involving various faculties to explore how the field of study influences interest in using ChatGPT. The results will allow profiling of students based on the variables examined, revealing their level of knowledge and attitude towards using ChatGPT for educational purposes. This research, involving students from humanities and scientific disciplines, underscores their crucial role in shaping the future of educational technologies. Practical and theoretical implications could lead to more effective and personalized forms of learning, revolutionizing the education and learning sector.',

    title: 'Citizenship Status and the Family and Medical Leave Act: Examining Inequities in Eligibility Among Hispanic Workers.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is the sole U.S. policy protecting job security during medical or parental leave. We extend prior work by analyzing overall FMLA eligibility by citizenship and gender among Hispanic workers. We examine which criteria-employer size, job tenure, and minimum work hours-drive citizenship disparities. We also investigate the factors predicting FMLA eligibility and examine the population-level characteristics contributing to FMLA citizenship disparities.\n' +
      'METHODS: We used the 2018 Current Population Survey (n = 5632) to compare FMLA eligibility by citizenship status among Hispanic foreign-born workers by sex. We used multivariate linear regressions and Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions to investigate citizenship inequities in FMLA eligibility.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Findings showed eligibility disparities: 38.9% of noncitizen men and 42.2% of noncitizen women met FMLA criteria compared to over half of their citizen counterparts. For men, this disparity stemmed primarily from differences in employer size, with less than half of non-citizens working for eligible employers. For women, both employer size and job tenure contributed to the ineligibility. Decomposition analyses showed that educational and occupational differences explained roughly half the employer-size citizenship disparity among men. Among women, occupation, full-time status, and education accounted for 85% of the employer size disparity. Age, residency duration, and full-time status explained nearly 75% of the job tenure citizen gap.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The FMLA's design excludes Hispanic non-citizens during critical life events. Addressing occupational segregation and educational barriers and modifying eligibility criteria are crucial to mitigating these disparities. A national paid family and medical leave policy is urgently needed.",

    title: 'Investigating the Role of Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status and Germline Genetics on Prostate Cancer Risk.',
    abstract: 'Genetic factors play an important role in prostate cancer (PCa) development with polygenic risk scores (PRS) predicting disease risk across genetic ancestries. However, there are few convincing modifiable factors for PCa and little is known about their potential interaction with genetic risk. Our study explores the role of neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES)-and how it may interact with PRS-on PCa risk. We analyzed incident PCa cases and controls of European (cases=5,960; controls=93,990) and African (cases=109; controls=1,226) ancestry from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort. Using the English Indices of Deprivation, a set of validated metrics that quantify lack of resources within geographical areas, we performed logistic regression to investigate the main effects and interactions between nSES deprivation and genetic susceptibility to PCa, represented by a multi-ancestry PRS comprised of 269 genetic variants. The PRS was associated with PCa in the European (OR=2.04; 95%CI=2.00-2.09; P=5.34x10) and African (OR=1.35; 95%CI=1.16-1.58; P=1.05x10) ancestries. Additionally, nSES deprivation indices were inversely associated with PCa: employment, education, health, and income. From this, we suspect that PRS, through biological mechanisms, and nSES deprivation, likely through differences in screening, are associated with PCa, but act independently of each other. Our findings suggest that genetic factors and social determinants of health measured by neighborhood socioeconomic status do not synergistically increase risk of PCa.',

    title: 'Evaluating short-term air pollution-related mental health resilience using a directional network.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that air pollution is among the most important triggers of mental health risks. However, little is known about the resilience strategies that reduce mental health risks among individuals exposed to pollution. The interconnections of protective and risk factors further complicate the understanding of mental health resilience. Therefore, this study developed a resilience assessment framework accounting for factor interconnections to evaluate the short-term air pollution-related mental health resilience.\n' +
      'METHODS: Aligned with mental health resilience theory, a Bayesian network model and network analysis were applied to construct a quantitative network of factor interconnections, analyzing 2019-2020 data for 24,261 older adults from the Shandong Aging and Mental Health Survey. On the basis of the network, mental health resilience was assessed via multiple-criteria decision-making method. The most influential pollutants, vulnerable populations and strategies to increase mental health resilience were then proposed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Air pollution exposure directly and indirectly affected mental health outcomes, defining a directional network where fine particulate matter emerged as the most influential pollutant. The mean index for short-term air pollution-associated mental health resilience was 0.52 ± 0.18. Resilience was significantly lower among females, adults aged 65-75, and less-educated individuals (mean index: 0.518 (95% CI: 0.515-0.521), 0.517 (95% CI: 0.515-0.520), and 0.516 (95% CI: 0.513-0.519), respectively). Memory lapses for sex/education disparities, irritability and feeling afraid for age disparities demonstrated the steepest disparities across demographic subgroups and bridge nodes-critical junctures that mediate resilience dynamics between populations. In terms of conditional probability, adjusting resilience factors proved more effective than merely reducing exposure.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: This study has illuminated a directional network linking air pollution to mental health, with a specific focus on fine particulate matter. Thus, enhancing mental health resilience against air pollution requires a coordinated yet targeted approach, prioritizing interventions for fine particular matter exposure. Furthermore, policymakers should address resilience disparities by tailoring interventions to mitigate memory lapses (which exhibit sex/education gaps) and irritability and feeling afraid (associated with age-related vulnerabilities).',

    title: 'Household wealth and its association with non-adherence, quality of life, anxiety and depression amongst hemodialysis patients in two centers in Cameroon.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked to poorer outcomes among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including those undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Limited data are available from Sub-Saharan Africa. In this region, traditional SES indicators like education and income can be challenging to measure. Household wealth may serve as a more reliable SES indicator. Our aim was to evaluate SES using household wealth, its association with non-adherence, quality of life, anxiety and depression among hemodialysis patients in Cameroon.\n' +
      "METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted over four months in one urban and one semi-urban hemodialysis facilities in Cameroon. Consenting adult patients on maintenance hemodialysis for at least three months were included. Patients with cognitive impairment or language barriers (English or French) were excluded. Household wealth was assessed using the World Bank's household wealth index adapted for Cameroon. Non-adherence was defined as missing ≥ 2 hemodialysis sessions within a six-week period. Quality of life was evaluated using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 (KDQOL-36) questionnaire. Anxiety and depression risk were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n" +
      'RESULTS: A total of 199 participants were included, with 52.8% (n = 109) males and a median age of 46 [IQR 36-56] years. Poverty affected 47.7% (n = 95) of participants, urban dwellers being more susceptible (52.5% n = 73 vs. 36.7% n = 22, p = 0.039). Poor participants had a greater percentage of patients < 46 years (56.8% n = 58 vs. 49% n = 40, p = 0.001) and unmarried status (43.1% n = 41 vs. 28.9% n = 30, p = 0.014). Non-adherence frequency was higher among poorer participants (42% n = 40 vs. 25% n = 26, p = 0.01). Globally, the quality of life was low across all household wealth groups. However, poorer participants experienced less physical function impairment (39% n = 37 vs. 52.9% n = 55, p = 0.04), fewer emotional role limitations (9.5% n = 9 vs. 19.2% n = 20, p = 0.048), and less depression (13.7% n = 13 vs. 26% n = 27, p = 0.04). In multivariate analysis, poverty increased the risk of non-adherence by 4.3 (95%CI 2.063-8.969, p < 0.001) and decrease the risk of depression by 0.7 (95%CI 0.063-0,963, p = 0.045).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Poverty, as assessed by household wealth, is common among hemodialysis patients, particularly the younger patients and urban dwellers. It is associated with increased risk of non-adherence but a lesser risk of depression.',

    title: 'Gender-based distribution of depression and anxiety following acute coronary syndrome in the Turkish population: are women at higher risk?',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common psychological disorders following acute coronary syndrome (ACS), potentially affecting patient outcomes. Sex-based disparities in the prevalence of these disorders may significantly impact recovery and rehabilitation post-ACS.\n' +
      'AIMS: To evaluate gender-based differences in depression and anxiety prevalence among Turkish patients following (ACS), and to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with psychological distress.\n' +
      'METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, 604 patients (144 women and 460 men) diagnosed with ACS were enrolled at their initial outpatient follow-up (4-8 weeks post-discharge). Data collection included demographic and clinical surveys along with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Depression and anxiety were significantly more prevalent in women than men (61.1% vs. 37.4% for depression, p < 0.001; 30.6% vs. 20.0% for anxiety, p = 0.008). Moderate-to-severe symptoms were also more common among women for both conditions (p < 0.001). Lower education levels and income below expenses were associated with higher anxiety and depression scores (p < 0.025). Among women, married individuals reported higher anxiety than widowed/divorced women (p < 0.001). Hypertension significantly increased distress, particularly in men (p < 0.001), while chronic kidney disease had a stronger impact among women (p < 0.018).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: There are marked gender disparities in depression and anxiety prevalence post-ACS, with women being significantly more affected. Socioeconomic disadvantages and comorbid conditions contribute to psychological distress. Routine psychological screening and sex-sensitive interventions, especially for vulnerable groups, are crucial for improving outcomes after ACS. Significant gender disparities exist in post-ACS depression and anxiety, with women disproportionately affected. Socioeconomic disadvantage and comorbidities further compound psychological distress. Integrating routine mental health screening and sex-sensitive interventions into post-ACS care is essential, particularly for high-risk populations, to improve long-term outcomes.',

    title: 'Adherence to benzathine penicillin prophylaxis and associated factors in patients with rheumatic heart disease attending two public hospitals in Bahir dar, Ethiopia.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Regular intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin every two to four weeks is a critical and cost-effective secondary prevention strategy for reducing morbidity and mortality from rheumatic heart disease (RHD), particularly in resource-limited settings like Ethiopia. However, there is limited evidence of adherence to this prophylaxis. Therefore, this study aimed to assess adherence to benzathine penicillin prophylaxis used for secondary prevention and its associated factors among patients with RHD attending follow-up clinics at two public referral hospitals in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.\n' +
      'METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 346 patients with RHD attending the follow-up clinic at Tibebe Ghion and Felege Hiwot specialized hospitals from October 1st, 2023 to January 20, 2024. Data was collected through questionnaire-based face-to-face interviews and a review of medical records. The data was entered into EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 27 for analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with good adherence to benzathine penicillin prophylaxis. Adjusted odds ratio at a p-value of less than 0.05 was used to assess the strength of the statistical association.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among 346 patients with RHD (97% response rate), the study found an overall adherence rate of 63.6% (95% CI, 58.6-68.8) to benzathine penicillin G (BPG) prophylaxis. Factors associated with good adherence included mild to moderate pain at the injection site (AOR = 2.44; 95% CI 1.45-4.09), good awareness of the purpose of BPG (AOR = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.11-3.59), urban residence of patients (AOR = 3.58, 95% CI 1.99-6.41), prophylaxis duration of ≤ 5 years (AOR = 4.15, 95% CI 1.58-10.88), prophylaxis duration 5-10 years (AOR = 3.83, 95% CI 1.32-11.13), and no history of admission in the last year (AOR = 3.05; 95% CI 1.67-5.54).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The level of good adherence in this study is sub-optimal. Factors positively associated with adherence included urban residence, mild to moderate injection site pain, awareness of BPG purpose, shorter prophylaxis duration, and absence of recent hospital admissions. To improve adherence, healthcare providers should implement targeted patient education programs and adopt effective pain management strategies as part of routine follow-up care.',

    title: 'Premarital intervention based on attachment and differentiation improves communication and conflict management in Iranian couples.',
    abstract: 'This study examined the effectiveness of a premarital intervention based on the Attachment-Differentiation Premarital Model (ADPM) in enhancing communication patterns and conflict management skills among Iranian engaged couples. The engagement period is a pivotal stage for future marital quality, yet many couples-particularly in collectivist societies like Iran-lack access to structured relational education. In this quasi-experimental study using a pretest-posttest control group design, 40 participants (20 couples) were selected from a university-affiliated counseling center and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (10 couples) or control group (10 couples). All participating couples resided in a married student dormitory and represented various cultural regions of Iran. The experimental group received 8-10 structured ADPM-based sessions, while the control group received no intervention during the study period. Communication patterns were measured using the Couples Communication Patterns Questionnaire (CPQ), and conflict management styles were assessed using the Rahim Organizational Conflict Inventory-II (ROCI-II). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) revealed significant post-intervention improvements in integrating (F = 21.90, p < 0.001), obliging (F = 19.49, p < 0.001), compromising (F = 8.73, p < 0.01), and dominating (F = 9.53, p < 0.01) communication styles, alongside a significant reduction in avoidance (F = 42.16, p < 0.001). Improvements were also found in constructive conflict communication (F = 8.13, p < 0.01), and reductions were observed in avoidance (F = 13.21, p < 0.001) and demand/withdrawal styles (F = 9.28, p < 0.01). These findings suggest that the ADPM offers a theoretically grounded and culturally responsive framework for premarital education, particularly in contexts where relational autonomy and emotional expression are constrained by traditional norms.',

    title: 'Psychological distress and its association with gender, socioeconomic status, education and health conditions.',
    abstract: 'Psychological distress represents a growing concern in contemporary society, with its prevalence often exacerbated by various demographic and health-related factors. Understanding the interplay of gender, socioeconomic status, education, and health conditions is crucial for developing effective mental health interventions. This original cohort-based study investigates the impact of gender, socioeconomic status (SES), education, and existing health conditions on psychological distress levels. This study utilized cross-sectional data from the Ravanser Non-Communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort, focusing on Kurdish individuals aged 35 to 65 in the Ravanser district of Kermanshah, Iran. Psychological distress was evaluated seven years post-recruitment using a validated scale, involving 3,015 randomly selected participants from the original cohort. Descriptive statistics summarized psychological distress distributions, while multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for various covariates, explored associations between SES, education, and psychological distress, with significance set at p < 0.05. Significant findings include higher psychological distress levels in females (20.56 ± 8.58) compared to males (17.41 ± 7.22) and a strong association with socioeconomic status, where poorer individuals reported greater psychological distress (20.52 ± 8.89) than their wealthier counterparts (16.84 ± 6.79). Education level was also critical, with illiterate individuals experiencing higher psychological distress (19.98 ± 8.42) compared to those with postgraduate education (17.43 ± 7.18). Additionally, individuals with cardiovascular disease (20.92 ± 8.75) and depression (24.82 ± 9.92) exhibited significantly higher psychological distress levels. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing mental health should consider demographic factors, socioeconomic status, education, and existing health conditions to effectively reduce psychological distress in vulnerable populations.Overall, these findings underscore the complex interplay of gender, SES, and education in influencing psychological distress, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.',

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the importance of vaccination, particularly for individuals with chronic conditions. However, vaccine acceptancy is influenced by psychological distress and coping mechanisms. This study aimed to examine the influence of mental health issues (anxiety, depression, and stress) and coping strategies on vaccine acceptancy.\n' +
      'METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 457 individuals with diabetes and hypertension attending two healthcare facilities in Ghana. Participants completed validated measures, including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Africultural Coping System Inventory (ACSI), and the COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance Scale. Descriptive statistics, correlational analysis and hierarchical regression analysis were used to assess predictors of vaccine acceptancy using Jamovi statistical software version 2.6.63.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The study found that stress, anxiety, and depression were strongly correlated, with higher levels of psychological distress linked to lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptancy. The multivariate results after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, anxiety (β = - 0.439, p <.001) and depression (β = - 0.455, p <.001) were strong negative predictors of vaccine acceptancy. Cognitive-emotional debriefing (β = 0.129, p =.012) was the only coping strategy significantly associated with higher vaccine acceptancy, while spiritual, collective, and ritual coping strategies had no significant impact after controlling for confounders. Education level (β = - 0.136, p <.001) remained significant predictors indicating that highly educated individuals showed lower vaccine acceptance.\n' +

    title: 'Accessibility To Ethnic Food Stores Authorized by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in Washington State.',
    abstract: 'The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is a U.S. federal nutrition assistance program that provides low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, infants, and children up to age 5 with supplemental foods, healthcare referrals, and nutrition education. At least 20% of participants of WIC in Washington state are immigrants. Information on how many WIC-authorized stores are ethnic stores, where immigrants could more readily access culturally preferred foods, is unknown. This study aims to assess the availability and distribution of WIC-authorized ethnic stores in Washington state, relative to the location of immigrant WIC-eligible populations. Data on the location of WIC-authorized stores, classified as ethnic or non-ethnic stores, were obtained from the Washington WIC Shopper mobile app. Sociodemographic information for each census tract was obtained from the American Community Survey 2017-2021. We estimated the distribution of, and distance to, WIC-authorized ethnic stores, compared across census tracts with high versus low proportions of foreign-born individuals and WIC-eligible children in Washington state. Almost 1/3 (29%) of census tracts in Washington state had WIC-authorized stores; 1.7% had WIC-authorized ethnic stores. Census tracts with high proportions of both foreign-born individuals and WIC-eligible children, compared with census tracts with low proportions, had more ethnic stores (14.5%) and shorter distances to them (3.0 km). Census tracts in Washington state with higher proportions of foreign-born individuals and WIC-eligible children had better physical access to WIC-authorized ethnic stores, though these stores are rare. Future research should explore barriers and facilitators for ethnic stores becoming WIC-authorized.',
