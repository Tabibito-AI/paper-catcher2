    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Economics of education',
    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    abstract: 'ABSTRACT In this paper we ask, what is mainstream economics education conveying to its students? Standard mainstream economics textbooks treat the environment as a specialist issue in addition to standard concerns and based on solutions that conform to those standard concerns. When viewed as socialisation for students this is a major problem. To illustrate the problems we set out key aspects of the standard format, and draw attention to the structure and contents from two well-known textbooks. Standard textbooks convey the impression that the ‘environmental issue’ is appropriately incorporated and exhibit two complacency-creating features. First, fundamental problems (acute global ecological breakdown, biodiversity loss, climate change crisis etc), issues and urgency cannot be adequately conveyed to students within this way of framing economics. Second, specific theory and policy solutions suggest that the problem is well in hand. We illustrate using the theory of negative externalities.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    title: 'The development of OPEC: an evolutionary game theory and agent-based modeling approach',
    summary: 'Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) evolved from a largely ineffective and disorganized group into the dominant force in international crude oil markets. In this paper we employ a methodological toolkit comprised of evolutionary game theory and agent-based modeling to study the development of OPEC over this period. Our evolutionary game theory model incorporates energy-specific variables and behavioral considerations to depict the actions of cartel members over the period of interest. Our agent-based model provides detailed results and demonstrates the importance of growing oil reserves to the outcome of the model.',

    title: 'FFF School Strikes as Alternative Civic Classroom: Sociomaterial Entanglements, Assemblages, and Spatial Imaginaries',
    summary: 'In 2018, thousands of students across the world left their classrooms on Fridays to march the streets, demanding that the adult world face and act upon the climate crisis. Much due to the pace with which the phenomena known as Fridays for Future (FFF) spread in both social and mass media, 2019 saw the largest mobilizations for the climate in history with many young people participating in civil disobedience for the first time. Narratives and frames of a school not providing what young people need to face an uncertain future emerged amidst the school strikes, which prompted this latest wave of youth-led climate activism, bringing about imaginaries of what such an education could look like. Informed by a body of literature which acknowledges the educational value of social movements in general and FFF in particular, this article positions the school strike demonstrations organized by FFF as figurations of an alternative civic classroom . With analytical sensibilities found in socio-material and postdigital theorization on educational spaces, this study draws on ethnographic empirical material from fieldwork at six school strikes in Stockholm, Sweden, to investigate the co-production of these events between the human and non-human — illuminating the way in which spatial imaginaries entangle human practice and technological materiality in alternative civic education in an out-of-school context. Such youth-organized spaces of civic action configured as alternative classrooms in the postdigital context may act as spaces where ‘futures in the present’ are materialized by the young people of today who will inhibit these futures tomorrow.',

    title: 'Adolescents’ Advanced STEM Course Intentions: Predictors and Reasoning',
    summary: 'Taking advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses in high school can support persistence in STEM. Given gender enrollment inequities in many advanced STEM courses, the current study explored potential gender differences in predictors of and reasoning about advanced STEM course intentions in a sample of high school students. Participants ( N  = 750, M age = 15.10 years, SD  = 0.83, 50.5% boys) attending five public high schools in the southeastern United States responded to online questionnaires regarding their current STEM classes and advanced course intentions as well as an open-ended item to capture their STEM intention reasoning. Examining results of the multi-group logistic regression and adolescents’ open-ended responses reveals potential gender differences in motivational factors and highlights the importance of utility value and receiving good STEM class grades (i.e., A’s and B’s) in shaping their advanced STEM course intentions. Findings also suggest that bolstering girls’ interest, self-efficacy, and perceptions of competence in STEM encourages their high school STEM course enrollment. Parental encouragement and others’ efforts to foster utility value and expectancy value can encourage boys’ and girls’ interest in enrolling in advanced STEM courses.',

    title: 'Alternating self-administration sessions of cocaine and heroin impact drug-related motivation and vocalisations in rats',
    summary: 'Rationale Animal models of addiction often study changes in motivation after repeated self-administration of a single drug. However, human users frequently consume multiple drugs, potentially altering their motivation and affective response. Objectives This study investigated how individual rats differentially self-administer cocaine and heroin, and whether motivation to take each drug was associated with affective states, as indicated by ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs). We also determined whether opioid antagonism (via naltrexone), which is known to decrease heroin-taking and associated USVs, also altered motivation and vocalisations for cocaine. Methods Male Lister Hooded rats, with surgically implanted catheters, self-administered cocaine and heroin on alternating days. Motivation was evaluated via drug intake escalation (fixed-ratio schedule), behavioural adaptation to dose reductions (behavioural economics), and progressive ratio breakpoints (with or without naltrexone). USVs were recorded and analysed using machine learning software (DeepSqueak). Results Rats escalated intake of both drugs during training. At the start of each session, rats rapidly self-administered cocaine or heroin; this drug-loading behaviour was associated with an increase in 50 kHz vocalisations. Rats altered their cocaine and heroin intake when drug doses decreased, and this was accompanied by reduced 50 kHz USVs. Lastly, naltrexone reduced progressive ratio breakpoints for heroin but not cocaine; naltrexone also decreased 50 kHz USVs for heroin (an effect which persisted). Conclusions Distinct patterns emerged in motivation and USVs between cocaine and heroin self-administration. Notably, USV frequency did not consistently align with motivation, especially when drug dosage changed. Future research may clarify this divergence.',

    summary: 'In-school enabling programs are emerging across Australia as an alternative pathway to university for secondary students, with a particular focus on widening participation. The importance of these programs is likely to grow considering the recent Australian University Accord recommendations for equity targets. However, little is known about these programs. This study contributes to bridging this gap by developing a desktop scoping inquiry, consisting of a literature review and mapping of existing programs, into what is currently known about in-school enabling programs in Australia. A particular focus is on where these programs fit within the landscape of university pathways available to secondary students and what role they might play in providing equitable access for underrepresented students. Findings suggest that in-school enabling programs are primarily responding to larger structural issues with streaming practices and the traditional Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) pathway with programs attempting to alleviate some of the entrenched inequity at play.',

    title: 'Educational infrastructure challenges in tribal regions in India: an enquiry in the context of NEP 2020',
    summary: 'India’s National Education Policy 2020 recognizes the vital role of physical infrastructure in improving quality of education. In India, the tribal regions, though, suffer from unique challenges due to geographical remoteness, cultural distinctiveness, economic marginalization, and inadequate infrastructure leading to educational disparities compared to non-tribal areas. This paper explores the complex relationship between physical infrastructure and educational quality among marginalized communities. Acknowledging the recognized impact of physical infrastructure on educational outcomes, the study addresses the gap in terms of lack of comprehensive studies particularly focused on these areas. To address this gap, we introduce a model to identify key determinants that enhance physical infrastructure and, consequently, educational quality. Study uses exploratory factor analysis to develop a Quality of Education Index and applies confirmatory factor analysis to assess the performance of 2481 tribal schools in Jhargram (West Bengal), a predominant tribal district in India. Additionally, a structural equation model is employed to identify the primary factors influencing educational quality in these schools. The key findings emphasize the importance of focusing on sanitation, healthcare, and building infrastructure, supporting the idea that a comprehensive approach, including both academic and non-academic aspects, is essential for enhancing education in India’s tribal regions.',

    title: 'Systematics review of the interdisciplinary exchange among mathematics education and neuroscience',
    summary: 'This paper presents systematic survey of empirical studies that implement neurocognitive tools to study mathematical processing, learning and problem solving. The survey comprised three stages: identification, screening, and analysis. The search was restricted to English-language papers published in research journals. Of a total of 35,692 records that were identified initially, 598 papers were found eligible for precise data analysis through screening procedure. The bibliometric analysis focused on publication years, journals and authors as well as on collaboration between the researchers. In the content analysis, along with the analysis of neurocognitive tools used in the studies, we screened the papers for the groups of research participants; mathematical topics, concepts and skills examined in the studies. We found that there has been tremendous growth in the past decade in the use of neurocognitive tools to research mathematics learning. The most commonly used tools are the fMRI, EEG, and eye tracking, while use of tools such as GSR and fNIRS remains highly uncommon. There is a strong focus on studying arithmetic, and a recent trend toward examining problem-solving skills, but higher mathematics learning and equation solving remain under-researched. Finally, we found that despite the immense growth in neuroscience research relevant to mathematics education, few studies of this type are published in mathematics education journals.',

    title: 'The Power of Apprenticeships in Shaping Preservice Teachers’ Confidence and Understanding of the Nature of Science in Thailand',
    summary: 'This study examines the impact of a 90-h apprenticeship on Thai preservice science teachers’ confidence and understanding of nature of science (NOS). Twenty-eight participants, specializing in physics, chemistry, biology, or general science, engaged in a hands-on apprenticeship under practicing scientists. To evaluate NOS, pre- and post-apprenticeship assessments were conducted using a 5-point Likert scale to measure participants’ confidence in NOS tenets, while the VNOS Form C, which focuses on understanding of NOS tenets, was administered only post-apprenticeship . Pre-apprenticeship, participants exhibited moderate confidence in NOS, particularly in areas related to creativity and the socio-cultural aspects of science. After the apprenticeship including reflective discussion, significant improvements were observed. Post-apprenticeship survey results showed strong agreement across all NOS tenets, with mode values of 5 and significantly reduced quartile ranges (IQRs), indicating greater consensus among participants. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that participants’ median total score was significantly higher than the threshold score of 12 ( V  = 133.5, p  = 0.0067), indicating enhanced NOS comprehension. These findings suggest that experiential learning, such as apprenticeships, plays a critical role in shaping preservice teachers’ confidence and understanding of NOS by bridging theoretical concepts with real-world scientific practices. This study emphasizes the need for integrating both authentic scientific experiences and explicit NOS discussion in teacher education programs to foster a well-rounded understanding of nature of science.',

    title: 'Social Justice Teacher Education in Latin America for a Post-COVID-19 World: A Systematic Review',
    summary: 'Social Justice Teacher Education (SJTE) prepares teachers to confront issues of inequity and marginalization within educational contexts—an endeavor that has become increasingly relevant in highly unequal regions in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review maps research on social justice (SJ) theoretical approaches and the production of empirical knowledge about SJTE in Latin American, identifying predominant research foci, theoretical currents, and regional findings. Following PRISMA guidelines, the review included a meta-analysis (metatheory/meta-data) of 52 indexed works (WoS, Scopus, and Scielo Citation Index) published up to 2022. The results show that most research is concentrated in Chile and Brazil, and that theoretical approaches intersect U.S.-based SJTE frameworks and Latin American or international critical educational theories, emphasizing the importance of situated and community-based pedagogies. Most works focus on preservice teachers’ conceptions of SJ, or the challenges faced by teacher educators during the design or implementation of specific SJTE activities. Fewer studies examine SJ-oriented teaching activities designed and implemented by preservice teachers as part of the fieldwork experiences, with the purpose of transforming the realities of marginalized students in local communities. The studies underscore the need to position care, affectivity, and the development of empathy as guiding principles of SJTE and teaching, especially in contexts of continuous political unrest. Further analysis of the design, implementation, and (self-)evaluation of SJTE programs’ pedagogical models, beyond punctual experiences, would contribute to understanding how their decision-making proccesses enable—or constrain—the development of socially just programs, as well as which pedagogical practices facilitate the development of the competences that their future teachers will need to work in challenging post-COVID-19 educational systems.',

    title: 'Longitudinal study of factors predicting toothbrushing less than twice daily at age 2 years in the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study.',
    abstract: "We aimed to identify factors predicting toothbrushing less than twice daily at the age of 2 years. The data from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study of 506 mother-father pairs (with 506 children) were used. Logistic regression analyses were conducted of the outcome (brushing less than twice daily) at the age of 24 months. Independent variables were parental age, parental education, siblings in the household, use of childcare service, and information about whether the parents are divorced, as well as brushing of the child's teeth and the parents' own teeth at 12 months with their first order interactions. More than one quarter of the parents reported brushing their child's teeth less than twice daily at the age of 2 years. The strongest predictor for brushing the child's teeth less than twice daily at the age of 24 months was brushing child's teeth less than twice daily at the age of 12 months; the effect was significantly stronger for those children whose fathers had low education than for those whose fathers had medium/high education. Other predictors were mother's and father's own brushing at 12 months, childcare at home, and mother's low education. To improve toothbrushing in young children, early intervention is needed in families where parents brush their own teeth less than twice daily and in families with low education.",

    title: 'One size does not fit all: how type of menopause and hormone therapy matters for brain health.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Menopause is an inflection point in the ageing trajectory. Independent of chronological age, menopause is associated with the biological ageing of several body systems. In this review, we highlight the importance of considering the influence of menopause - its types, symptoms and interventions - on brain health. Supplementing the loss of ovarian hormones with menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) may be key for supporting the healthy brain ageing of females. MHT has been associated with reduced risk of several neurodegenerative diseases; however, its benefits are not always observed on brain health.\n' +
      'AIMS: This narrative review highlights often overlooked MHT factors that influence its effects to produce positive or negative effects on brain health, cognition and neurodegenerative disease risk. These factors include the many varieties of MHT, including formulation, administration route and dosing schedule, as well as individual characteristics, particularly the presence of vasomotor symptoms and apolipoprotein ε4 (APOE4) genotype.\n' +
      'METHOD: PubMed and Scopus were used to identify articles with relevant search terms.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Menopause factors, including age, abruptness and symptoms, influence brain ageing. MHT influences brain health, with transdermal MHT showing more positive effects on brain ageing, but its effectiveness may depend on individual factors such as genotype, reproductive and lifestyle factors.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: To develop effective and individualised MHT treatments, further research is needed. Preclinical models must consider the type of human menopause and MHT. To achieve the greatest dementia prevention in females, more menopause education and care is needed that extends beyond 60 years of age, or 10 years postmenopause.',

    title: 'From Awareness to Action: teaching ethical decision-making to health-care leaders.',
    abstract: 'This article presents a novel pedagogical approach for teaching ethical decision-making to health-care leaders, offered through a collaboration between the Harvard Medical School Center for Bioethics and the Advanced Ethics in Leadership Program (AELP). The approach centers on the AELP Triple-A Framework, which guides participants through the process of identifying ethical issues, analyzing competing values, and developing strategic, context-sensitive action plans. Unlike traditional medical ethics education that often focuses on patient-physician relationships and clinical challenges, this model emphasizes leadership challenges within complex health-care organizations and trains clinicians and health leaders to respond ethically and effectively to systemic pressures. The framework is taught through immersive, implementation-focused workshops that combine pre-readings, case-based exercises, small-group collaboration, and iterative feedback. A featured case study on physician unionization illustrates how participants used the framework to move beyond technical solutions and engage deeply with questions of professional identity, institutional culture, and ethical leadership. Through this exercise, participants reconceived unionization not merely as a labor dispute but as a reflection of deeper organizational and moral tensions. The workshop model fosters the development of ethical leadership skills that are both principled and practical, enabling clinicians to navigate the evolving challenges of contemporary health care with moral clarity and strategic competence.',

    title: 'Health Equity as Mission and Source of Moral Distress: examining health systems actions through a conflict of interest lens.',
    abstract: "In recent years, health systems throughout the United States have made public declarations committing to health equity. Yet clinicians in these systems often feel they are not set up to support equitable care. This discrepancy between proclaimed commitments and on-the-ground realities is one of the major reasons for the continued rise in clinician moral distress. Hospitals' mission statements are often multifaceted. Therefore, when one facet, such as research or education, is prioritized, another, such as health equity, may suffer. Do these represent conflicts of interests? Ethical dilemmas? What about the fiduciary responsibilities of a health system? How do those come into play when a hospital is deciding which aspects of its mission to prioritize? This article discusses hospital missions, values, and fiduciary responsibilities; characterizes the nature of the conflicts that arise when key aspects of these commitments and responsibilities are at odds; and offers hospitals and health systems insights for characterizing these conflicts when they arise. By assisting health systems to communicate better with their staff, the authors hope to propel systems further towards achieving health equity and concurrently decrease clinician moral distress.",

    title: 'Nitrogen Addition and Warming Drive Multilevel Plant Carbon Allocation via Storage-Growth Trade-Offs: A Meta-Analysis.',
    abstract: 'Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition and global warming are becoming increasingly severe, yet their combined effects on plant carbon allocation, a key factor influencing ecosystem carbon sequestration, remain poorly understood. Through a global meta-analysis (1371 experimental output observations), we investigated how N addition and warming regulated carbon allocation strategies across multiple plant levels and species types. Results revealed that N addition significantly enhanced above-ground nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) storage, whereas both warming and N addition reduced below-ground NSC reserves. However, N addition and warming did not produce synergistic effects on whole-plant NSC storage. In contrast, the combined treatment of N addition and warming synergistically promoted structural growth at the above-, below-ground, and whole-plant levels. Herbaceous plants exhibited NSC-driven plasticity under N addition, whereas woody plants demonstrated stronger biomass accumulation under warming, aligning with their distinct carbon economics. In addition, environmental factors (e.g., soil total nitrogen, soil organic carbon) also modulated these responses, showing that high soil nitrogen reduced below-ground NSC allocation. Our findings challenge the assumption of linear organ-level combined effects of N addition and warming on plant carbon allocation and highlight the need to incorporate plant species types and environmental heterogeneity into carbon cycle models under multi-stressor global change.',

      'MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted between 2016 and 2021 as part of the Araraquara Cohort Study that assessed quarterly anthropometry of 719 and 667 infants to evaluate, respectively, the effects of type of delivery on weight gain velocity (WGV) and length gain velocity (LGV) using generalized estimating equations.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The type of delivery was not associated with WGV or LGV in the first year of life. Higher mean WGV was observed among infants born to mothers with higher education, male infants, formula-fed infants, and those with the lowest birth weight, while infants with diarrhea had lower mean WGV. Higher mean LGV was found among formula-fed infants and infants born to taller mothers, while infants with the highest length at birth had lower LGV.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The factors that explain WGV and LGV in this population are more closely related to maternal characteristics such as height and educational attainment, birth characteristics, feeding behavior, and morbidity than to the type of delivery.',

    title: 'Identification of gaps in the continuum of maternal and neonatal care in a high-mortality setting: An observational study in rural Guinea-Bissau.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Coverage of the continuum of maternal and neonatal care, including antenatal care (ANC), childbirth and early postnatal care (PNC), is critically low across sub-Saharan Africa. Meanwhile, related monitoring remains neglected. We quantified coverage gaps along the continuum of maternal and neonatal care in rural Guinea-Bissau and assessed background factors associated with continuum-of-care completion.\n' +
      "METHODS: In a cross-sectional study using data from the Bandim Health Project's nationally representative rural health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS), we assessed individual-level obtainment of ≥1, ≥4 and ≥8 ANC contacts (ANC1/4/8), facility-based childbirth and PNC within 24 h postpartum for HDSS-registered births between 1 February 2023 and 31 January 2024. Among facility births, we also assessed postpartum admission ≥24 h. We defined continuum-of-care completion as the obtainment of ANC4, facility-based childbirth and PNC within 24 h and investigated associations between background factors (household assets, maternal age, education, parity, region, ethnicity, health facility distance and recall time) and continuum-of-care completion in regression models.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Among 2258 births, 35% (n = 798) completed the continuum of care; 22% (n = 494) obtained none of the contributing services. Individual service coverage ranged from 6% (ANC8, n = 128) to 99% (ANC1, n = 2236). Individual coverage of the services included in the continuum-of-care assessment was 62% (n = 1403) for ANC4, 56% (n = 1268) for facility-based childbirth and 52% (n = 1167) for PNC. Continuum-of-care completion differed by region and ethnicity. Living near a health facility, higher maternal education, more household assets, low parity and longer recall time were associated with higher continuum-of-care completion.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Continuum-of-care completion is low in rural Guinea-Bissau and not fully reflected by individual coverage indicators. This calls for a higher focus on continuum-of-care coverage and related gaps, both locally and globally. Meanwhile, the identified higher reporting of continuum-of-care completion with longer maternal recall questions the use of survey data and beckons for monitoring based on timely routine data.',

    abstract: 'Rationale and ObjectiveCompared to in-center hemodialysis, home dialysis may better address the needs of some individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, home dialysis utilization is lower in African American and Hispanic individuals with ESKD. We sought to identify the factors that most influence dialysis modality choice, specifically home dialysis, in these individuals and their care partners.Study DesignQualitative research study using focus groups.Setting and ParticipantsFifty-seven participants, including African American and Spanish-speaking Mexican American individuals on dialysis (both in-center and home) and care partners, were recruited to in-person focus groups in five US metropolitan areas. Mexican American focus groups were held in Spanish language and translated in real time by a certified interpreter; recordings for all focus groups were transcribed verbatim for analyses.Analytical ApproachParticipant responses were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis techniques.ResultsPhysician guidance was cited as the most important factor in making the initial modality decision for all groups. African American respondents primarily relied on healthcare professionals for information, but also seek independent validation (e.g., "trust but verify"). Mexican American respondents stated that trust in physician recommendation is largely unquestioned, influenced by factors such as cultural respect for physician authority, limited literacy, and language barriers. African American respondents desire additional education about modalities, particularly when they feel ready to comprehend content (sequenced to recognize how overwhelming it can be at the initial diagnosis of kidney failure). Although most individuals on dialysis and their care partners acknowledged the clinical benefits of home dialysis, significant barriers to choosing a home modality included the fear of being solely responsible for a complex procedure and loss of social interaction and/or support from other individuals on dialysis and center staff.LimitationsAs the focus groups were all conducted in metropolitan areas, the transferability of the findings to other settings is uncertain.ConclusionsImproved educational programs on dialysis modality choice should build on the strong preference for physician-led health information to better address educational needs of African American and Mexican American individuals facing the choice of a dialysis modality. Tackling issues pertaining to understanding kidney disease pathogenesis and addressing trust in healthcare professionals is necessary in African American individuals. In Mexican American communities, specific emphasis should be placed on addressing literacy and language barriers. Home dialysis educational material for both groups should also incorporate content regarding concerns about safety and social isolation.',

    title: 'Study on the factors associated with preparation for later life among aging individuals with disabilities.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: This study examined factors associated with later-life preparation among aging individuals with disabilities living in South Korea.\n' +
      'METHODS: We used secondary data from 2,942 individuals aged 50 and older from the Disability Life Panel Survey and performed binary logistic regression.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Most participants did not prepare for later life and were men, had a high school education or less, and were unemployed. Logistic regression identified factors associated with later-life preparation: education level and employment status (Sociodemographic characteristics); types of disability and recent health condition (health condition); self-esteem and disability acceptance (psychological factors); and residential environment assessment and satisfaction with family relationships (environmental factors).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the need for a comprehensive approach to preparing aging individuals with disabilities for later life.',
