    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'The Role of Remote Activities in Urban Mobility in the Post-COVID-19 Era',
    summary: 'This study examines how remote activities, particularly teleworking and tele-education have been associated with urban mobility patterns in Greece during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing on shifts in travel behavior and attitudes toward future mobility trends, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 1,115 respondents, primarily from Thessaloniki’s academic community. The survey assessed mobility habits across three time periods (pre-, during, and post-pandemic), remote activity practices, future intentions, and socio-demographic factors. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were carried out to identify key determinants shaping future mobility and remote activity preferences. Results show significant behavioral changes, with walking, private vehicle, and bus use declining sharply during the pandemic. Prior to COVID-19, 80% of employees had no teleworking experience, yet 60% transitioned to working remotely five or more days weekly at the pandemic’s peak. Findings highlight strong support for continuing telework and remote learning post-pandemic, indicating lasting shifts in work, education, and urban mobility patterns.',

    title: 'The Effectiveness of 3D Virtual Environments for BPMN Teaching: A Quasi-Experimental Study',
    summary: 'Traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, being static and highly abstract, often hinder comprehension, particularly for novice designers and students. This can lead to misinterpretations and process inefficiencies. In this study, we investigate whether immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments can enhance the understanding of BPMN models. We developed a virtual reality (VR)-based BPMN visualization tool and conducted a quasi -experiment with 48 academic and professional participants, who interacted with a 3D BPMN model using Google Cardboard and a joystick. Participants completed comprehension tasks before and after the VR experience. The results show significant improvements in understanding and engagement, suggesting that immersive virtual reality can be a valuable educational tool for BPMN learning. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the integration of 3D environments in process modeling education, offering benefits for both academic and professional training.',

    title: '“Flipped” University: LLM-Assisted Lifelong Learning Environment',
    summary: 'The rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the landscape of lifelong learning. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for a self-constructed lifelong learning environment supported by LLMs. It highlights the inadequacies of traditional education systems in keeping pace with the rapid deactualization of knowledge and skills. The proposed framework emphasizes the transformation from institutionalized education to personalized, self-driven learning. It leverages the natural language capabilities of LLMs to provide dynamic and adaptive learning experiences, facilitating the creation of personal intellectual agents that assist in knowledge acquisition. The framework integrates principles of lifelong learning, including the necessity of building personal world models, the dual modes of learning (training and exploration), and the creation of reusable learning artifacts. Additionally, it underscores the importance of curiosity-driven learning and reflective practices in maintaining an effective learning trajectory. The paper envisions the evolution of educational institutions into “flipped” universities, focusing on supporting global knowledge consistency rather than merely structuring and transmitting knowledge.',

    summary: 'Wastes should not be wasted - it might be opportunities for a brighter future. That is the idea behind Waste4Knowledge, an IoT-driven kiosk that turns discarded items like plastic bottle aluminum cans into opportunities for children to learn and grow. The system incentivizes children to recycle waste materials by rewarding them with items, stationeries, or access to education contents. It uses IoT sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller to check the recyclables and hand out rewards without a hitch. Its modular hardware design, combined with Firebase software, allows real-time data tracking, enabling administrators to analyze recycling trends, adjust reward strategies, and optimize the user experience dynamically. By integrating recycling and education, the W4K system offers opportunities to underprivileged children, fosters environmental responsibility, and inspires positive community behavior. Its adaptable design positions it as a scalable solution for sustainable development initiatives worldwide.',

    title: 'AI as teacher: effectiveness of an AI-based training module to improve trainee pediatric fracture detection',
    summary: 'Objective Prior work has demonstrated that AI access can help residents more accurately detect pediatric fractures. We wished to evaluate the effectiveness of an unsupervised AI-based training module as a pediatric fracture detection educational tool. Materials and methods Two hundred forty radiographic examinations from throughout the pediatric upper extremity were split into two groups of 120 examinations. A previously developed open-source deep learning fracture detection algorithm ( www.childfx.com ) was used to annotate radiographs. Four medical students and four PGY-2 radiology residents first evaluated 120 examinations for fracture without AI assistance and subsequently reviewed AI annotations on these cases via a training module. They then interpreted 120 different examinations without AI assistance. Pre- and post-intervention fracture detection accuracy was evaluated using a chi-squared test. Results Overall resident fracture detection accuracy significantly improved from 71.3% pre-intervention to 77.5% post-intervention ( p  = 0.032). Medical student fracture detection accuracy was not significantly changed from 56.3% pre-intervention to 57.3% post-intervention ( p  = 0.794). Eighty-eight percent of responding participants (7/8) would recommend this model of learning. Conclusion We found that a tailored AI-based training module increased resident accuracy for detecting pediatric fractures by 6.2%. Medical student accuracy was not improved, likely due to their limited background familiarity with the task. AI offers a scalable method for automatically generating annotated teaching cases covering varied pathology, allowing residents to efficiently learn from simulated experience.',

    title: 'Tech-Enhanced Learning: Evaluating General Education in Vocational Colleges Through Technology Integration',
    summary: 'In vocational education, the role of general education (GE) is pivotal in cultivating a well-rounded skill set among students. As the demands of the job market evolve, it becomes imperative to assess and enhance the efficacy of GE in these specialized settings. Vocational colleges (VC) and higher vocational institutions are essential in getting pupils ready for careers by offering specialized courses. However, the significance of GE cannot be overstated, as it provides a foundation for critical thinking, communication skills, and a broad intellectual perspective. This investigation aims to investigate the evaluation system of GE and related courses within VCs and higher vocational institutions. The study employs a descriptive mixed-methods approach. A purposive sampling technique was utilized to select participants. Using a questionnaire survey and interview method, the data for this paper was gathered from 157 teachers and 208 students. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS for statistical analysis. The findings identified that integrating technology-based evaluation methods enhances the effectiveness of GE programs in VCs. The result clarified that regular feedback and assessment in GE courses in higher VCs lead to better retention and understanding of the course content. The novelty of the study lies in assessing GE and courses in vocational and higher VCs, by exploring unique evaluation systems, it aims to enhance the quality of education, aligning curriculum with industry demands, and promoting well-rounded graduates in vocational settings.',

    title: 'Assessing the role of artificial intelligence in quality of legal education with special reference to sustainable development goal',
    summary: 'The transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly apparent in a variety of fields, including legal education. This study investigates the potential of AI in transforming legal education in order to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), 2030. As nations and cultures global struggle to achieve the SDGs, legal professionals play an important role in establishing legal frameworks that support progress toward these goals. It can improve the delivery of legal curricula by providing customized learning experiences targeted to individuals. AI can also help educators to create current content and enhance the evaluation. Education is now more dynamic, accessible, and affordable, expanding its reach. Quality of legal education is a cornerstone of achieving the SDGs set for 2030. The effective utilization of AI in the field of legal education holds significant promise in not only expanding access but also improving the quality of legal education. AI-powered legal research tools have the potential to revolutionize legal research for law students, researchers, and legal practitioners. They can provide more efficient and comprehensive ways to explore legal precedents, case law, and statutes, thus empowering legal professionals to perform their duties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By improving access to legal information, these tools can play a significant role in the formulation of laws and regulations that align with the SDGs. This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which AI can contribute to advancing legal education and, consequently, supporting the attainment of the SDGs.',

    title: 'Die Konzeption von Erfolg aus Sicht von Absolvent:innen mit Beeinträchtigung: Schlüsselaspekte der Inklusion in der deutschen Hochschulbildung',
    summary: 'Während sich in den letzten Jahren verschiedene Wissenschaftler:innen mit der Inklusion und dem Bildungserfolg von Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen auseinandergesetzt haben, bleibt die Frage, was diese selbst unter Studienerfolg verstehen, weitgehend außer Acht. Das erste Ziel dieses Artikels ist es, die Konzeptionen von Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Schlüsselfaktoren zu analysieren, die zum Hochschulerfolg von 28 Absolvent:innen mit Beeinträchtigung aus 16 deutschen Hochschulen beigetragen haben. Das zweite Ziel besteht darin, Empfehlungen zu geben, die die Teilnehmenden selbst an andere Studierende mit Beeinträchtigung sowie an die Hochschulen richten, um ihren Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung zu verbessern. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Teilnehmenden unterschiedliche Konzeptionen von Erfolg haben (Erreichen eines Abschlusses, gute Noten, Erlernen und Entwickeln von Fähigkeiten, Sammeln von praktischen Erfahrungen, Überwinden von Herausforderungen und Aufrechterhalten eines Gleichgewichts zwischen Studium und Gesundheit) sowie verschiedene persönliche Faktoren (die Behinderung als treibende Kraft) und kontextuelle Faktoren (soziales und familiäres Umfeld, Auslandsaufenthalte, positives Feedback, Anerkennung von Leistungen und zugängliche Online-Kurse und digitalisierte Materialien) als relevant für ihren Erfolg identifizierten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ferner, dass es für den Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Stärkung von Studierenden mit Beeinträchtigung entscheidend ist, die Stimmen von Absolvent:innen mit Behinderung zu hören. While various researchers have explored inclusion and the educational success of people with impairments in recent years, the question of what the latter mean by academic success remains understudied. The first aim of this article is to analyse the conceptualisations of success in higher education and the key factors that contributed to the academic success of 28 graduates with impairments from 16 German universities. The second aim is to provide recommendations from the participants themselves to other students with impairments and to higher education institutions for improving their success in higher education. The results show that the participants have different conceptualisations of success (achieving a degree, getting good grades, learning and developing skills, gaining practical experience, overcoming challenges and maintaining a balance between studies and health) and identified various personal factors (the disability as a driving force) and contextual factors (social and family environment, time abroad, positive feedback, recognition of achievements and accessible online courses and digitised materials), as relevant to their success. The findings further demonstrate that hearing the voices of graduates with impairments is critical to their success in higher education and the empowerment of students with disabilities.',

    title: 'Supplementation Matters: Academic Impact of an Afterschool Tutoring Program in Timor-Leste',
    summary: 'Students in Timor-Leste face low educational outcomes due to sociopolitical factors rooted in the nation’s colonial history. This study evaluates the academic impact of a low-resource afterschool supplementary tutoring program designed to address learning gaps and improve school outcomes across rural and urban settings. Using instructional design principles, the program employed worksheet-based individualized learning content in a familiar language, supported by personalized feedback. Pre- and post-test scores in mathematics and English were compared over 7 months between an intervention group and a comparison group, with results analyzed using a Welch t test. Findings revealed statistically significant improvements in both subjects, with greater gains in mathematics, suggesting an opportunity to explore alternative methods for English instruction, such as incorporating social interactions to support early learners. The study highlights the importance of community support, tutors’ capabilities, and their residence within local neighborhoods in sustaining the program. These results demonstrate the potential of well-structured afterschool programs to enhance educational outcomes in low-resource contexts, offering a scalable model for similar initiatives in emerging nations.',

    title: "Self-Report Alzheimer's Disease Statuses in UK Biobank Distort Downstream Analyses.",
    abstract: "Genetic studies have identified Alzheimer's disease (AD)-linked variants through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and proxy-based GWAS (GWAX), yet inconsistent causal inferences still persist. Here, we systematically evaluated how self-reported AD diagnoses in the UK Biobank (UKB) distort Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Using seven AD datasets (four GWAS and three GWAX, including IGAP, N = 63 926; FinnGen R10, N = 191 061; UKB G30, N = 420 531; UKB2024, N = 434 286, and GWAX2017, N = 74 366; GWAX2018, N = 548 955; GWAX2021, N = 408 691) and six education subtypes (including years of schooling, N = 1 131 881; hardest math class completed, N = 430 445; self-reported math ability, N = 564 698; college completion, N = 280 007; cognition test performance, N = 257 841; and non-cognitive skills, N = 257 841). We also assessed the heterogeneity and pleiotropy across these datasets. We found opposing causal directions between GWAS and GWAX cohorts. In GWAS datasets, genetic variations related to education were causally linked to a lower risk of AD (OR < 1, p < 0.05), with years of schooling showing the strongest protective effects (OR = 0.71 in IGAP, p < 0.05). Conversely, UKB-based GWAX analyses paradoxically linked education-related traits to increased AD risk (OR > 1, p < 0.05), directly conflicting with the protective associations in clinical AD GWAS results. Genetic heterogeneity was observed in both AD GWAS and GWAX datasets. Pleiotropy was noted in AD outcomes, but MR estimates remained stable after outlier adjustments. Our findings reveal that self-reported AD statuses in UKB distorted genetic effect estimates, particularly for education subtypes requiring validation. The research urges caution in interpreting MR results from GWAX studies that use self-reported endpoints and highlights the need for rigorous phenotyping in biobank studies.",

    title: 'Association Between Relative Leg Length and Insulin Resistance in Rural, Urban and Rural-Urban Migrant Populations of Peru.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between relative leg length and insulin resistance according to rural, urban, and rural-urban migrant groups.\n' +
      'METHODS: Cross-sectional study using data from the PERU MIGRANT study (2007-2008). The exposure was relative leg length categorized as short, normal, or long, and the outcome was insulin resistance (logarithm of homeostatic model assessment log-HOMA2-IR). Linear regression models with log transformation, adjusted for sex, age, parental education, hip circumference, and physical activity level, were employed to estimate geometric mean ratios of insulin resistance across leg length categories. Interaction effects of population groups (rural, urban, and migrants) on insulin resistance were explored, along with mediation analysis of central obesity and excess body fat in the main relationship.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Using data from 947 participants, 52.7% female, mean age 47.7 years (SD = 11.9), we found a robust inverse association between relative leg length and insulin resistance. The geometric mean of insulin resistance in subjects with long leg length was 43% (e: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.47-0.69) lower than those in the normal category. A significant interaction effect of the population group on relative leg length categories (p < 0.001) was observed, particularly in the migrant and rural groups. Excess body fat and abdominal obesity explained 33% and 12% of the association between relative leg length and insulin resistance, respectively.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Longer leg length was associated with lower insulin resistance values, with a greater interaction effect observed among the rural-urban migrant and urban groups. These findings support the hypothesis that metabolic disorders in adults may be traceable to nutritional and developmental conditions early in life.',

    title: 'Re-aligning social and behavior change to address structural determinants of health and improve health equity.',
    abstract: "While social and behavior change (SBC) programs have a history of addressing multiple social determinants of health (SDH), those interventions have sought primarily to influence the behaviors of individuals, groups, and communities, often overlooking underlying social and political causes of health inequities and the multiple ways SBC could address them. The SDH include (i) 'structural mechanisms,' or the social and political contexts that produce and sustain social stratification via socioeconomic position (SEP), which comprise social class, income, education, race/ethnicity, gender, and/or marginalization, and (ii) 'intermediary determinants,' including psychosocial factors, behaviors, and the health system itself. Currently, SBC programs consistently address intermediary determinants, but rarely design approaches to affect structural determinants. To strengthen SBC programming, it will be necessary to: develop/expand social determinants competency; engage with groups most disadvantaged by SDH using an intersectional lens; advocate for, and respond to, funding for SBC programming that addresses both structural and intermediary determinants; collaborate with partners across sectors; measure and evaluate the efficacy of SDH interventions; develop and apply measurement benchmarks aligned with long-term change processes; and demonstrate how health equity approaches align with multilevel health and development priorities and goals. Political will, donor commitment, implementers' actions, and community engagement working in concert to shape actionable goals for social change that benefit underserved or unserved populations can reduce inequities in health practices and outcomes. As partners in reimagining SBC and shifting the paradigm, SBC practitioners have important roles to play; this paper speaks explicitly to their needs, concerns, and opportunities.",

    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, with benefits such as personalized treatment and efficient diagnosis; however, it also comes with challenges such as data protection and ethical concerns.\n' +
      "AIM: This study examined nurse leaders' perceptions of AI's impact on their professional roles and their level of preparedness for AI integration.\n" +
      "METHODS: This descriptive correlational study was conducted at various hospitals in Hail City, Saudi Arabia. The Shinners Artificial Intelligence Perception tool was used to evaluate 155 nurse leaders' perceptions of AI and their readiness for its adoption.\n" +
      "RESULTS: The SHAIP tool, previously validated in international studies, was further adapted and validated for this context using confirmatory factor analysis and reliability testing, ensuring robust measurement of nurse leaders' perceptions and preparedness regarding AI. Nurse leaders showed a positive perception of AI's impact on their roles (mean score = 3.72), but lower perceived preparedness (mean score = 3.32). Education level (where holders of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing showed lower perceptions, with a coefficient of -0.66,  = .006) and department significantly influenced their perceptions of AI. No significant predictors of preparedness for AI were identified. Further, there was no correlation between the perceived AI impact and preparedness.\n" +
      "CONCLUSION: Although nurse leaders recognize AI's potential in healthcare, there is a gap between their perceptions and preparedness. Tailored education and training programs are required to enhance the integration of AI into nursing leadership and practice.",

    title: 'Factors Affecting Food Handling Practices Among Food Handlers at Food Establishments in Mogadishu, Somalia: A Cross-Sectional Study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIM: Foodborne diseases pose serious health challenges in developing countries like Somalia, contributing to high rates of illness and death due to inadequate food safety practices, poor sanitation conditions, ineffective regulatory systems, and a lack of educational resources for food handlers. This study determined food handling practices and their associated factors among food handlers in Mogadishu, Somalia.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 304 food handlers in Mogadishu, Somalia, and data were gathered through direct interviews. Analysis was performed using SPSS Version 26, including descriptive statistics and logistic regressions (binary and multivariate). Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) and a significance level of  < 0.05 were employed to assess significant variables related to food safety measures.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The results show that only 27.3% of food handlers practiced proper food handling procedures. This means that the majority of those observed exhibited poor food handling practices. Various factors significantly influenced these practices, including age (AOR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.05-0.21), marital status (AOR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.06-0.27), work experience (AOR = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.10-0.44), and monthly income (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.56-6.21).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The study revealed that over two-thirds of participants practiced poor food handling, posing public health risks. Key factors included age, marital status, work experience, and income. Authorities should improve health education, strengthen environmental health services, and train food handlers to enhance safety and health outcomes in Somalia.',

    title: 'Promoting a more empowering motivational climate in physical education: a mixed-methods study on the impact of a theory-based professional development programme.',
    abstract: "This study examined the effects of the delivery of a school-tailored ™ workshop and subsequent Professional Development Programme (PDP) using Community of Practice principles within one secondary school Physical Education (PE) department. Employing a mixed-methods longitudinal design, the research assessed PE teachers' understanding of motivation and motivational strategies, Senior Leadership Team perceptions of the PDP's impact, and pupils' motivation and engagement in PE. The intervention pulled from Achievement Goal Theory and Self-Determination Theory, adopting Duda's theoretically integrated conceptualization of empowering and disempowering motivational climates. Qualitative data from interviews, focus groups, and reflections revealed significant perceived benefits for teachers' understanding and implementation of motivational strategies, as well as perceived improvements in pupil engagement and motivation. Quantitative data (147 Year 9 pupils aged 13-14 years, M = 13.6, SD = 0.4; 81 boys, 64 girls) revealed no significant differences over time in perceptions of the motivational climate and their motivation to engage in PE. Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the benefits of creating empowering environments in physical education. The findings however highlight the complexity of implementing and assessing the effects of motivational climate interventions in PE settings and underscore the importance of sustained, theory-informed professional development for teachers. Areas for future research on interventions (and testing their effectiveness) to optimize the motivation climate in PE, pupil motivation and teacher professional development are provided.",

    title: 'Behavioral interventions for waste reduction: a systematic review of experimental studies.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Wasteful behavior poses major environmental, economic, and social challenges, yet the behavioral science literature on waste reduction remains fragmented.\n' +
      "METHODS: This systematic review synthesizes 99 experimental and quasi-experimental studies published between 2017 and 2021 that test behavioral interventions to reduce waste. This period captures a critical phase when global waste management systems faced unprecedented disruptions, including the 2017 launch of China's National Sword policy, which dramatically reshaped global recycling markets and exposed critical weaknesses in international waste systems. We adopt a broad definition of waste-including both discarded materials (e.g., food, trash, recyclables) and inefficient resource use (e.g., electricity, water, fuel)-to better capture the full range of behaviors where interventions can reduce environmental impact and allow cross-domain comparisons. Our goal is to examine the behavioral interventions used, how interventions are structured, how behavior is measured, and whether they target individuals, households, communities, or broader systems.\n" +
      'RESULTS: We identify six common types of behavioral interventions: education/informational feedback, social norms, economic incentives, cognitive biases and choice architecture, goal setting, and emotional appeals. Interventions targeting electricity and water use were most common, while food and solid waste remain under studied, largely due to measurement challenges. Although most studies used real-world field designs with direct behavioral outcomes, they focused heavily on individual and household behavior.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: This individual focus risks overlooking the structural and systemic changes needed to achieve broader, sustained reductions in waste. To advance the field, we call for greater use of community-level and system-wide interventions, investment in scalable measurement tools, and stronger collaboration between researchers, governments, and practitioners. Building on this foundation can help create more effective, scalable strategies to reduce waste across behavioral contexts.',

    title: 'PROTOCOL: the On Track 2.0 cluster randomized teacher-led intervention to support executive function and self-regulation.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The top-down cognitive and emotional control skills known as Executive Function (EF) and Self-Regulation (SR) have a large impact on everyday life. As a schoolchild, you are expected to pay attention, wait your turn, follow instructions, solve academic problems and be creative while navigating the social space of peers and teachers. All these abilities draw on EF and SR. Research has pointed to curricular programs as a promising path to build capacity in schoolteachers and provide with further knowledge on ways to support and strengthen these EF and SR skills in their pupils through activities, strategies and reflection tasks. The importance of EF and SR on later life outcomes such as academic performance, career, relationships and risk of crime, has been a motivating factor to develop the 10-session On Track 2.0 intervention as a universal whole-class approach to improve EF and SR in primary school pupils.\n' +
      'METHODS: Regular 4th and 5th grade class groups will be invited to participate in this teacher-delivered intervention program to be implemented into regular lessons. In this study schools will be randomly assigned to either intervention or control group as part of a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Psychometric and questionnaire assessing EF, SR and well-being will be administered to children, teachers and parents at three time points.\n' +
      "DISCUSSION: The intervention holds the potential to support and qualify teachers in understanding students' challenges with EF and SR better and in training these skills during class. A multimodal and multi-informant approach to assessment, in addition to data on teacher adherence and platform use, will aid the insight into the efficacy of the intervention content and delivery.\n" +

    abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Poor health literacy and resources paucity in families with low socioeconomic status can be detrimental in children requiring complex outpatient management such as heart transplantation. We assessed the influence of socioeconomic status and insurance type on heart transplantation outcomes.\n' +
      "METHODS: The cohort of children undergoing heart transplantation was generated by merging the United Network for Organ Sharing and Pediatric Health Information System databases. Family's annual income was used as surrogate for socioeconomic status. Children were divided into 3 groups: low-income (lower quartile, <$32 700; n = 639), medium-income (second and third quartiles, $32 700-$53 600; n = 1305), or high-income (upper quartile, >$53 600; n = 649).\n" +
      'RESULTS: Comparison showed racial discrepancies (more Whites in high-income, more Blacks in low-income groups), and insurance type variations (more private in high-income, more Medicaid in low-income groups). On univariate analysis, survival was higher for high-income compared with medium-income and low-income groups ( = .04). On multivariable analysis, Black race (hazard ratio, 1.389; 95% CI, 1.041-1.703;  = .0075), Medicaid (hazard ratio, 1.373; 95% CI, 1.115-1.721;  = .0038), and other government insurance (hazard ratio, 1.611; 95% CI, 1.104-2.423;  = .0126) were significant risk factors, whereas income group effect was neutralized. Treated rejection episodes at 1 year were lowest (10%) in high-income and highest (15%) in low-income groups, with trend for less rejection in the low-income group with private insurance (12% vs 16%). Death from cardiac arrest was significantly less in the high-income (8%) compared with the medium-income (18%) and low-income (19%) groups ( < .01).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Black and low socioeconomic status children face significant disadvantages in heart transplant outcomes, including lower survival, higher rejection rates, and increased risk of death secondary to cardiac arrest. Access to private insurance leads to better survival but might be proxy to better resources, education, and compliance.',
