    title: 'Mothers’ duties and rights when positioned as remote education tutors in Australian distance schooling',
    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Public management of digitalization into the Spanish tourism services: a heterodox analysis',
    summary: "This study is a critical review of public intervention and its management of change with digitalization, applied to Spanish tourism services, as ones of the largest case and most required of attention into the European Union. In comparison with other mainstream papers, this heterodox review is based on the combination of Austrian Economics and Neo-Institutional approaches ( Cornucopists ), with their common theoretical and methodological frameworks. Thus, it is possible to analyze failures and paradoxes in the public intervention, especially with post-COVID recovery policies. The case of the Spanish tourism sector highlights the effect of double bureaucracy, from European institutions and the Spanish Government, affecting its competitiveness and revealing the confirmation of heterodox theorems. Faced with mainstream public intervention guidelines, which usually involve expansive spending and more debt (and New-Malthusian measures), a heterodox mainline solution is offered here, based on the revival of the original sustainability principle, the readjustment effect and the promotion of geek'n'talent education, to facilitate the transition to the Knowledge Economy, where the tourism sector is capable of offering personalized travel experiences due to digitalization.",

    title: 'In pursuit of equity in upper secondary education: the curious case of Ghana’s free senior high school policy',
    summary: 'The Free Senior High School policy is Ghana’s attempt at actualising the SDG 4 global consensus on free upper secondary education. Using grounded theory method, this research scrutinises the Free SHS 2018 policy and strategy document, alongside interviews with policymakers, to answer the question: How does the equity provision ensure fairness in upper secondary education, and what equity blind spots exist? Specifically, the study employed a purposive sampling technique, allowing for the deliberate selection of data sources that ensured the collection of focused, meaningful data aligned with the research goals. The findings underscore a disconnect between the policy’s equity intentions and solutions. For example, the policy highlights that, intersectional differences—such as economic, school-based, gender, and regional factors—persist and drive inequitable access. However, these issues are inadequately addressed because the policy applies cookie-cutter-style economic solutions to all inequity concerns. Policymakers from within, and outside from government, hold diverse perspectives on the impact of this disconnect on sub-populations. The former underscores political and technical accountabilities where increasing numbers of enrolment are equated to equity, while the latter underscores differential policy effect sizes on sub-population to mean inequity. Curiously, the policy has improved access despite the equity conundrum, weak economy, lack of private–public initiatives, declining GDP allocation to education, no selective fee waivers, and neglect of secondary education expansion prerequisites. The paper advocates realigning the policy’s equity dimension with its equity goals.',

    title: 'A phenomenological reading of integration in the longitudinal integrated clerkship',
    summary: 'This paper reports on a phenomenological reading of integration in education programs, through three layers of specificity: (1) broadly, on integration as an educational idea; (2) more particularly, on integration as expressed in the program model of the longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC); and (3) with the highest degree of specificity, on integration ‘at work’ in an actual LIC program. Each layer of penetration found different aspects of the phenomenological nature of integration. A further integrative leap across these aspects phenomenologically revealed four essential qualities of integration, being: integration transforms parts into wholes; integration’s animating locus is mutable, mobile and multiple; integration is already at work and is sustained through possibility; and integration holds open for ‘more’ integration. By appreciating integration for its essential qualities, this research adds foundational value to the literature on educational integration, and opens new questions about how we, as educators, might deliberately work with both its presence and its promise in our educational pedagogies, practices and programs.',

    title: 'The positioning of quality and expertise in initial teacher education: policy enactment in the Australian context',
    summary: 'Teacher quality and teacher education improvement have been central discourses for at least two decades in global education. In Australia, despite the pervasive nature of these discussions, there is a lack of substantial evidence indicating the existence of a problem in this regard. Policies aimed at enhancing the ‘preparedness’ of teacher graduates and elevating the ‘quality’ of ITE programs have nonetheless emerged as prevalent solutions over the past decade. The latest enactment of reforms in the policy chain is the Strong Beginnings report from the Teacher Education Expert Panel. In this paper, we align with Ball’s perspective that policy should be viewed as a dynamic process rather than a presumed, ready-made solution to a problem. We utilise systematic conceptual coding using Leximancer to enable a nuanced exploration of the understandings, practices, and conditions of influence for the policy actors inscribed in the TEEP report. We also analyse concept frequency and collocation in the final Strong Beginnings report, noting two main propositions: first, that there is a problem with quality in ITE; and second, that practice is foregrounded in professionalisation. We highlight the consistencies and contradictions within the discourses of the final report and the submissions from policy actors that contributed to this policy enactment process. We suggest that evidence is used when it suits a policy position, but ignored if it disrupts the platform position. We conclude by arguing that the policy actors in this policy enactment process should be afforded the professional authority to continue a well-established process of continual improvement.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    summary: 'In this paper, we suggest that poetic inquiry offers a pathway for capturing the deeply felt, personal dimensions of ongoing identity growth of initial teacher educators of professional experience. We propose that poetic inquiry provides an avenue for authentically sharing experiences and insights into caring and being cared for, diverging from conventional academic narratives. Through poetic self-reflection and collective poetic representation, we can uncover and navigate the subtle tensions shaping our identity journey, fostering a communal understanding of the teacher educator’s role within the contexts of Australian higher education and initial teacher education.',

    title: 'Studying Year 6 students’ perceptions of gender and their engagement in STEM within an Australian primary school',
    summary: 'Gender stereotypes—and performances of femininity and masculinity—play a key role in how and why an individual engages in STEM education. Students’ perceptions of STEM have been carefully and consistently studied in high school and in tertiary education contexts, but to date there has been limited research examining students’ gendered perceptions of STEM at the primary school level. This small case study adopts a critical feminist approach and draws on classroom observations and semi-structured focus group interviews using photo-elicitation to foreground student voice. The aim of this research is to uncover how Year 6 students (n = 6) living and learning in Australia perceive STEM as a gendered discipline of study. Drawing on an inductive thematic analysis, we identified key differences between boys and girls which arguably have implications for their engagement in STEM. Our analysis foregrounds the role of (1) self-efficacy; (2) social pressures and performativity; and (3) pervasive gender norms, which all played a role in influencing students’ identities. We then consider the implications of these findings for educators. The article concludes with an examination of the limitations of the study as well as considerations for future research.',

    title: 'Educational Attainment Level and Risk of Mortality and Cardiopulmonary Outcomes in High-Risk Patients With Cardiovascular Disease: The INVESTED Trial.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Educational attainment level (EAL) is an indicator of socioeconomic status and has been shown to be inversely related with adverse health outcomes. However, the association between EAL and risk of clinical outcomes in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease has not been extensively investigated.\n' +
      'METHODS: In the INVESTED (Influenza Vaccine to Effectively Stop Cardio Thoracic Events and Decompensated Heart Failure) trial, patients with recent heart failure or myocardial infarction hospitalization were randomized 1:1 to high-dose trivalent or standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine from September 2016 to January 2019. We examined the association between EAL and risk of clinical outcomes for each participant across all enrolling seasons using adjusted Cox models stratified by trial entry season. Participants were categorized by EAL (≤high school, post-high school or trade, and ≥college).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of the 4912 participants (mean age: 65.5 years, 28% female, 80% White) with EAL information, 43% had high school, 29% had post-high school or trade, and 28% had ≥college as EAL. Those with higher EAL were more likely to be White or Asian, be married/with long-term partner, have higher left ventricular ejection fraction, have lower New York Heart Association class, and less likely to have comorbidities and risk factors than those with lower EAL. During follow-up (median: 9 months), 1706 (35%) participants experienced the composite of all-cause death or cardiopulmonary hospitalization. Compared with high school, higher EAL was associated with a stepwise decrease in risk (post-high school or trade: hazard ratio [HR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.79-0.99]; ≥college: HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.63-0.81],  <0.001).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: High EAL is significantly associated with a decreased risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease after adjustment for other key risk factors, highlighting the need to consider EAL in risk assessment and target additional resources toward those with low EAL to improve prognosis.\n' +

    title: 'Black Women as Superwomen? The Mental Health Effects of Superwoman Schema, Socioeconomic Status, and Financial Strain.',
    abstract: `Informed by Black feminist thought and intersectionality, Superwoman Schema (SWS) is a construct that captures a collective response of Black women to racial and gender marginalization by highlighting expectations that they exude strength, suppress emotions, resist vulnerability, succeed despite limitations, and help others to their own self-neglect. Using a sample of Black women (N = 390) in early-midlife (between 30 and 46 years old;  = 37.54 years;  = 4.29), this study integrates the intersectionality framework and the stress process model to examine the independent and interactive effects of SWS endorsement as well as socioeconomic status (SES) and financial strain on Black women's mental health. Study results reveal that SWS dimensions "emotion suppression" and "obligation to help others" are associated with elevated depressive symptoms. In addition, net worth and financial strain, but not traditional measures of socioeconomic status such as education and income, moderate the association between SWS endorsement and depressive symptoms. Specifically, the association between SWS and depressive symptoms is strongest among Black women reporting negative net worth or high financial strain (e.g., not being able to make ends meet). Broader implications and future research directions are discussed.`,

    title: 'Protocol for Conducting Scoping Review on Reliability and Validity of Low-Stakes Assessments in Medical Education.',
    abstract: 'Low-stakes assessments (LSAs) are widely used in medical education to promote continuous learning by providing formative feedback and minimizing the high-stress environment associated with high-stakes assessments. While LSAs are recognized for their role in supporting student learning, questions remain about their reliability and validity. This scoping review aims to systematically identify and synthesize existing literature on the reliability and validity of LSAs within medical education contexts. This study aims to map the methodologies used to establish psychometric parameters, identify problems, and offer best practices. The review will use the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, encompassing a comprehensive search across six academic databases and grey literature to identify relevant studies published from 2000 onward. Two reviewers will independently screen and extract data, using the Covidence tool for systematic screening and data extraction. Data will be analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide an overview of reliability and validity evidence for LSAs in medical education. Insights into motivational and psychometric theories, such as Self-Determination Theory, Classical Test Theory, and Generalizability Theory, that inform LSA design and implementation will be used to analyse the findings in this review. Expected outcomes include a detailed map of the literature on LSA reliability and validity, identification of key challenges, theoretical underpinnings and recommended strategies for improving LSA practices in medical education. Findings will inform future research and provide guidelines for optimizing the use of LSAs to enhance student learning outcomes, assessment integrity, and the educational experience in medical training.',

This local data study examined the SEEQ's psychometric properties in Omani education, specifically its validity and reliability. This local data study examined the SEEQ's psychometric properties in Omani education, specifically its validity and reliability.\n" +
      "METHODS: This was quantitative research to assess educational quality from the students' viewpoint. The study was conducted at Muscat College from January to March 2024.Simple randomization implemented at the course level helped to choose the participants. All students registered in the specified courses were asked to take part after a random sample of the courses Muscat College offers throughout the study term was chosen. Five hundred fifty students completed the survey. AMOS was used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and PSS was used to evaluate the internal consistency ( IBM Corp., 2024a, 2024b).\n" +
      "RESULTS: CFA of the SEEQ indicated that the eight -factor solution best fit the data. Results also showed that the SEEQ has overall good-to-excellent reliability. The adapted scale was psychometrically sound, proving SEEQ's applicability.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes using SEEQ to measure Oman's education quality.",

    title: 'Right hemisphere engagement in language abilities in older adults: indication of compensation rather than decline.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Structural brain changes during aging have been used as specific markers to distinguish normal aging from dementia. Changes in specific cognitive abilities such as episodic memory, processing speed, and executive functions, are observed in healthy aging. Limited evidence reports changes in linguistic functions alongside structural and functional brain changes. This study investigates correlations between language performance, gray matter volume (GMV), and neural activity in language regions, adjusted for demographic factors, in healthy older adults.\n' +
      'METHODS: Twenty-seven right-handed participants aged 60-87 were evaluated for overall linguistic performance using the Spanish version of ScreeLing (SCL) test and phonemic fluency and semantic verbal fluency tasks (PF and SF). Participants also underwent an MRI session during which they performed a functional MRI language task. T1-weighted MRI scans were used to measure GMV in specific language-related regions and assess language lateralization. Correlational analyses were conducted between language scores, GMV, years of education, age, sex, and fMRI lateralization.\n' +
      'RESULTS: In the right hemisphere (RH), significant positive correlations were found between SCL scores and GMV in the orbital inferior frontal gyrus (r = 0.5402; p = 0.0044) and the superior temporal gyrus (r = 0.516; p = 0.007). Furthermore, SCL and Phonemic fluency positively correlated with years of education, indicating that higher education enhances speech performance. No significant correlations were found in the left hemisphere (LH). Age, sex, and fMRI lateralization did not significantly correlate with specific linguistic scores.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: These results challenge the current view of the role of the right hemisphere in language performance as increased GMV in specific right hemisphere language regions is associated with better language performance, highlighting the role of the right hemisphere in supporting language skills during healthy aging.',

      _: '"" caregiver perspectives on the difficulties of COVID-19 implementation transitions for children and youth with special healthcare needs (CYSHCN).',
      i: [Array]
    },
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 virus and its relevant prevention protocol had significant impacts on children and youth with special healthcare needs (CYSHCN), including those with physical, intellectual, and developmental disabilities. Previous studies have examined the first year of the pandemic, identifying the implications of social distancing, remote services/education, and masking and testing protocol on the mental, physical, and developmental well-being of this population.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVES: We focus on moments of transition, when vaccines were disseminated and mandates/resources removed. By identifying how protocol and interventions in these moments included, neglected, or negatively impacted CYSHCN, we can inform more inclusive, safe, and equitable decision-making in future health crises.\n' +
      "METHODS: We report the transition-moment-related reflections of fourteen focus groups conducted among caregivers (including parents) of CYSHCN between March and December of 2022 ( = 77). Focus groups were conducted in close partnership with a local non-profit organization, and facilitation protocol were co-developed by community leaders in the CYSHCN area. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using directed content analysis and thematic analysis, guided by implementation science theories on interventions' relative dis/advantages and perceived adaptability.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Caregivers provided transition-moment reflections of how the timing, support, and in/flexibility of pandemic intervention implementation and de-implementation negatively impacted their CYSHCN. We generated three themes to describe these views: (1) ":" Lack of transition support into isolation meant loss of necessary structures and services; (2) ":" Transition communication, particularly surrounding mandates and protocol, was not handled well for CYSHCN; and (3) ":" Transition timing neglected consideration of CYSHCN.\n' +
      "DISCUSSION: CYSHCN needs were neglected in the pandemic's transition moments, creating significant implications for their mental/emotional, physical, and cognitive/developmental well-being. Reflecting these findings, and particularly facets that extend established literature, we urge inclusive research and policy models, empowering members of the CYSHCN community as leaders in knowledge and protocol production, particularly when considering the adaptability and relative advantage of interventions. Such models are crucial in developing messaging around pandemic policies, creating infrastructural support for flexibility, and adding supports and delays when de-implementing mandates.",

    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Our research investigated the impact of mobile phone distance video education of patients with type II diabetes. This approach was delivered to 100 type 2 diabetes patients based on their cognitive-social factors and metabolic variables.\n' +
      'SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial study design was employed. Diabetes education videos were designed and were streamed to the smartphones of the patients. Data were collected from the control (n=50) and experimental (n=50) groups in the first interview, and metabolic control data were recorded. The second interview was held three months after the education process was completed. During this meeting, the survey instrument and the Turkish version of the Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire was re-administered to both groups, and metabolic control data were recorded.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Following the distance video education, there was a significant decrease in the FPG (1.2 mmol/L) HbA1c (-1.04%), LDL (-0.4 mmol/L) and BMI (-0.7 kg/m) values of the experimental group, and their cognitive-social factors were found to improve in terms of perceiving diabetes.\n' +

    title: 'Occupational zoonoses, neurological diseases, and public health: A one health approach.',
    abstract: 'Zoonotic diseases, which constitute 60% of all human infectious diseases, present substantial risks to public health, economies, and livelihoods. These diseases emerge at the human-animal-environment interface, with occupational exposure representing a critical yet underexamined dimension of zoonotic risk. Workers in high-risk sectors such as agriculture, wildlife management, and laboratory research face elevated exposure to zoonotic pathogens, often under conditions of inadequate preventive measures and resource constraints. Neurological disorders resulting from zoonotic infections, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalitis, and meningitis, illustrate the severe health consequences for occupational groups. Cases linked to swine hepatitis E virus, West Nile virus, , and  underscore the urgent need for robust surveillance and targeted interventions. The Ecohealth approach, integrated with the One Health framework, provides a transformative model for managing zoonotic risks by addressing the upstream drivers of disease emergence. By emphasizing environmental stewardship, ecological balance, and socio-economic equity, Ecohealth fosters sustainable preventive strategies. Occupational medicine is crucial in linking workplace safety with public health through tailored risk management, enhanced surveillance, and targeted education. Despite these frameworks, significant barriers persist, including data gaps, underreporting of occupational diseases, and insufficient coordination among health sectors. Addressing these challenges requires implementing standardized occupational health surveillance systems, enhancing reporting mechanisms through digital tools, and promoting cross-sectoral data-sharing initiatives. Successful models, such as sentinel surveillance programs in agricultural sectors and integrated biosurveillance networks, demonstrate the feasibility of these strategies. Leveraging these approaches can facilitate early detection, improve reporting accuracy, and support evidence-based interventions.',
