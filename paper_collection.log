    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Analyzing the User Experience of Virtual Pedagogy in Architecture Education',
    summary: 'This study aims to analyze the user experience of virtual pedagogy in architecture education. It seeks to gather valuable feedback and perceptions from teachers and students regarding the effectiveness, challenges, and benefits of virtual pedagogy. The study employs a quantitative research design using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the user experience, challenges, advantages, and overall satisfaction with virtual pedagogy in architecture education. The findings reveal the widespread use of tools and applications, such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and Zoom etc., for delivering both studio-based and non-studio-based courses in the virtual learning environment. The study highlights several challenges associated with virtual pedagogy, particularly for studio-based subjects, including the lack of in-person experience crucial for effective learning, difficulties in providing hands-on training, discouragement of active learning, and inadequate access to specialized tools and software. Additionally, the findings indicate that while virtual pedagogy offers flexibility and accessibility, it faces challenges in replicating the spontaneous interactions and hands-on nature of traditional in-person design studios.',

    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate socio-demographic, reproductive, lifestyle and health factors associated with the age of natural menopause in the Brazilian context.\n' +
      'METHOD: The cross-sectional study was conducted with data from 3538 women who reported natural menopause from the baseline (2008-2010) to the date of the second visit (2012-2014) of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). The outcome of the study was the age of natural menopause. The association between socio-demographic, reproductive, lifestyle and health characteristics and the age of menopause were investigated using multiple linear regression.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The mean age of natural menopause was 49.5 years. The following conditions were associated with a younger age at onset of menopause: lower education level, historically marginalized races/skin colors and smoking. By contrast, multiparity and contraceptive use for less than 3 years were associated with a higher mean age at the onset of menopause, related to no previous pregnancies and no contraceptive use.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: The study findings provide relevant support for the development of public policies aimed at preventing early menopause and promoting comprehensive and continuous care for women's health.",

    title: 'Evaluating the Educational Value and Content Quality of YouTube Videos on Myasthenia Gravis.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Although numerous YouTube videos on myasthenia gravis (MG) are available, the educational quality and comprehensiveness of this digital health information have not been assessed. This study addresses that gap using structured scoring tools to evaluate informational value for both patients and healthcare professionals.\n' +
      "METHODS: A systematic search on December 3, 2024, retrieved the top 50 English-language YouTube videos on MG. The videos were assessed using the modified DISCERN scale (1-5), Global Quality Scale (GQS; 1-5), and a custom comprehensiveness checklist (0-5). Descriptive, comparative, and inter-rater analyses were performed. Group comparisons used the Kruskal-Wallis test; associations were analyzed with Spearman's correlation.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Substantial agreement was observed (κ = 0.79). The median video duration was 8 min with a median of 53,459 views. The mean DISCERN score was 3.18 (±1.06), indicating moderate quality of treatment-related information; the mean GQS score was 2.88 (±1.02), reflecting moderate overall usefulness and coherence; and the mean comprehensiveness score was 2.78 (±1.11), showing moderate coverage of educational content. Higher comprehensiveness was positively associated with longer duration, more likes, and professional orientation (p < 0.05). The educational content varied: symptoms (84%) and treatments (70%) were commonly covered, whereas rehabilitation (8%) and long-term management (10%) were rarely included.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: Although the mean scores indicated moderate quality, significant variability in educational depth was observed. The limited representation of rehabilitation and chronic care content suggests the need for more comprehensive and balanced digital resources on MG.',

    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Personalized medicine (PM) is advancing disease prevention and treatment, but regulatory and clinical concerns persist, requiring evaluation of healthcare professionals' (HPs) knowledge and attitudes.\n" +
      'METHODS: His study assessed PM awareness among HPs at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Participants from diverse clinical departments completed a survey covering PM definitions, benefits, ethical concerns, genetic testing knowledge, attitudes, and barriers. A literature review guided question development.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among 141 HPs (55.3% male, 44.7% female), only 27.7% reported sufficient PM knowledge, though 82.3% acknowledged genetic health influences. Those with adequate knowledge more often endorsed PM tools (92.3% vs. 68.6%,  = 0.01) but expressed greater concern about healthcare disparities (82.1% vs. 67.6%,  = 0.03). Key barriers included cost (17%) and ethical risks, with 72% fearing PM would widen economic gaps and 23.4% anticipating insurance discrimination. Females and married HPs were more concerned about discrimination ( = 0.039 and  = 0.038, respectively). Despite concerns, 80% of physicians supported genome-guided prescribing.\n' +

    title: 'Locally-tailored vs. centrally-administered strategies for implementation of primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening in an integrated healthcare system: a qualitative research study.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Primary human papillomavirus HPV testing is recommended for cervical cancer screening for women aged 30-65 years without a history of abnormal results. However, there is little clear guidance regarding effective strategies for implementing primary HPV screening. As part of an ongoing randomized trial comparing implementation strategies for primary HPV testing (a centrally administered + usual care strategy vs. centrally administered + locally tailored strategy), we evaluated clinician experiences and perceptions of large-scale implementation of primary HPV screening in an integrated healthcare system, Kaiser Permanente Southern California.\n' +
      'MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with internal medicine, family medicine and obstetrics/gynecology clinicians to gain insight into fidelity to the interventions and implementation strategies, barriers and facilitators to implementation, and recommendations. Participants from both arms of the trial were recruited. Interview guides were developed with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). We recruited physicians, licensed vocational nurses, and medical assistants after primary HPV screening had been implemented. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Using a team coding approach, we developed an initial coding structure refined during iterative analysis; data were subsequently organized thematically into domains, key themes, and sub-themes using thematic analysis, followed by framework analysis informed by CFIR.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Thirty-two interviews were conducted. Participants in both arms of the trial noted high awareness, preparedness, buy-in, and fidelity to the new screening process. Initial barriers concerned specimen collection, proper ordering, and lab delays. An unanticipated barrier was the length of time needed to return lab results for reflexive cytology tests after a positive HPV result which reportedly increased patient anxiety. Participants in both arms reported fidelity to the centralized strategy (e.g., attending webinars, leadership announcements). In the local-tailored arm, few participants recalled the local-tailored resources.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: The centralized strategy was perceived as highly acceptable and feasible, and fidelity to the associated interventions appear to be facilitators of practice change. Recommendations for improving implementation included patient education, outreach and ongoing clinician training. Findings can be applied to other health systems and settings considering primary HPV screening implementation, particularly those within the U.S. or with a similar health care model.\n' +

    title: 'Comparative Analysis of Artificial Intelligence-Generated and Human-Written Personal Statements in Emergency Medicine Applications.',
    abstract: 'Introduction Personal statements (PSs) have long been part of the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) application; however, there exist only limited guidelines for their creation and even fewer for their role in the application review process. Applicants invest significant time in writing their PSs, and still, program directors rank PSs among the least important factors in interview and rank order list decisions. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, has introduced questions of ethics and originality across all aspects of education, particularly in the generation of free-form documents such as the PS. This study evaluates whether AI-generated PSs are distinguishable from authentic ones written by applicants and their perceived impact on residency selection. Methods Five AI-generated PSs were created using ChatGPT, incorporating applicant location, hobbies, and career background. Five de-identified, authentic PSs randomly selected from incoming emergency medicine (EM) interns were used for comparison. A Qualtrics survey was distributed electronically to the Council of Residency Directors (CORD) community. Respondents rated the PSs on writing quality, ability to convey personal attributes, and perceived influence on interview decisions. Statistical analyses (ANOVA and Wilcoxon tests) were used to assess differences between AI-generated and authentic statements. Results A total of 66 responses were collected over a two-month period. Of these, eight respondents did not regularly review ERAS applications, and 28 did not complete the survey beyond the initial question, leaving 30 responses for analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between AI-generated and authentic PSs in grammar and writing style (p = 0.5897), expression of personal attributes (p = 0.6827), overall quality (p = 0.2757), or perceived influence on interview decisions (p = 0.5457). Free-text comments reflected skepticism about the value of the PS in the selection process. Conclusion AI-generated PSs performed comparably to authentic ones, potentially further challenging the relevance of PSs in residency applications. These findings suggest an inherent lack of originality in the PS and may support re-evaluating the role of the PS and even exploring more meaningful ways to assess applicant fit in the residency selection process. Novel methods, such as structured interviews, standardized video responses, personality inventories, or situational judgment tests, may be considered to supplement the role intended for the PS.',

    title: "Assessing and enhancing pediatric residents' knowledge and skills in tracheostomy care through simulation-based training.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The pediatric residency program in Saudi Arabia currently does not include tracheostomy care as a competency. Research has indicated that nonsurgical residents have limited knowledge of tracheostomy management. This study aimed to establish the need for pediatric residents to be trained in tracheostomy care and the effectiveness of having such a training program.\n' +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional and interventional study included all pediatric residents who completed a self-assessment questionnaire of confidence levels, an objective knowledge assessment, and a hands-on routine pediatric tracheostomy tube change assessment on a mannequin. A targeted tracheostomy workshop was tailored to pediatric residents using didactic presentations and hands-on simulation practice.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Forty-two residents participated in this study. The residents had limited experience with tracheostomy care, as they had not received formal training in this area nor practiced changing a tracheostomy tube independently. Thirty-one residents (73.81%) felt incompetent in assessing patients with a tracheostomy, and 39 (92.86%) lacked confidence in performing tracheostomy tube change care. The levels of confidence among the residents, knowledge regarding management of tracheostomy, and clinical expertise in tracheostomy tube change was significantly higher after the workshop than their scores measured prior to the workshop.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This study illustrates that the healthcare professionals in pediatrics are not self-assured and knowledgeable in the field of tracheostomy care and, thereby, establishes the necessity of a specific tracheostomy educational program to enhance the self-assurance, knowledge, and competency in performing the practice.',

    title: 'Exploring the role of DeepSeek-R1, ChatGPT-4, and Google Gemini in medical education: How valid and reliable are they?',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to rapid advancements in science, technology, industries, healthcare settings, and medical education. A Chinese-built large language model, DeepSeek-R1, inspires the scientific community as an affordable and open alternative to earlier established US-based AI models, ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro. This study aimed to explore the role of "DeepSeek-R1, ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro" and to assess the validity and reliability of these AI tools in medical education.\n' +
      'METHODS: The current cross-sectional study was performed in the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the period January 25, 2025, to February 28, 2025. The Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) bank was created with a pool of basic medical sciences (60 MCQs) and clinical medical sciences (40 MCQs). The one hundred MCQs were prepared from various medical textbooks, journals, and examination pools. The MCQs were individually entered into the given area of the "DeepSeek-R1, ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro" to assess the level of knowledge in various disciplines of medical sciences.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The marks obtained in basic medical sciences by DeepSeek R1 47/60 (78.33%), ChatGPT-4 47/60 (78.33%), and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro 49/60 (81.7%). However, in clinical medical sciences, the marks obtained by DeepSeek R1 were 35/40 (87.5%), ChatGPT-4 36/40 (90.0%), and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro 33/40 (82.5%). The total marks obtained by DeepSeekR1 were 82/100 (82.0%), Chat GPT-4 84/100 (84.0%), and Google Gemini-1.5 Pro 82/100 (82.0%).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese-based DeepSeek-R1, the US-based ChatGPT-4, and Google Gemini-1.5 Pro achieved similar scores, exceeding 80% marks, in various medical sciences subjects. The study findings demonstrate that the knowledge, validity, and reliability levels of DeepSeek R1, ChatGPT-4, and Google Gemini 1.5 Pro are similar for their potential future use in medical education.',

    title: 'Beyond individual barriers and facilitators: Digital interventions to address diabetes in urban Ghana.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Ghana and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is increasing at a rate notably higher than the rest of the world. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop low-cost community interventions for diseases including T2D in Ghana, with digital tools potentially empowering community members in prevention and management. This research aimed to identify effective strategies for leveraging digital tools to address T2D in Ga Mashie, Ghana, through community-driven empowerment and action.\n' +
      'METHOD: This was a mixed methods study involving focus groups (N = 13), qualitative interviews with community representatives (N = 69) and two community workshops (N = 35 participants in each).\n' +
      'RESULTS: The focus groups and interviews identified strong facilitators for an individual-level digital intervention focused on education; however, workshops highlighted that the community wants greater access to in-person education and healthcare services in Ga Mashie, limiting the likely impact of an individual digital intervention.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Our findings challenge the widespread assumption that digital interventions should be targeted at the individual; rather, digital tools might be used to empower community leaders in Ga Mashie with training and clinical guidance to function as healthcare agents, scaling-up the delivery of education and screening services to their broader community. This suggests a novel system-level strategy for designing community-based, empowerment-focused digital health interventions that reflect the practices and values of community members, though further work is needed to validate this approach.',
