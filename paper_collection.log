    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +
      'national income model, government-purchases multiplier and tax multiplier.',

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin\n' +
      'Longitudinal Study (WLS), I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment\n' +
      'predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when\n' +
      'respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about\n' +

      'covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status,\n' +
      'is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is\n' +
      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +
      'propose a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of\n' +
      'education and remains as a significant predictor of economic growth when tested\n' +
      'with both cross-section data and panel data. We argue that future research on\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +
      'Linear amplification yields S-functions as only analytic solutions.\n' +

      'quantitative information on long-term demand. The theory is self-consistent. It\n' +
      'reproduces all peaceful data from 1800 to date without adjustable parameter. It\n' +
      'has full forecasting power since the decisive parameters are constants of the\n' +

    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +

      'to enable the students to understand deeper the principles and methods\n' +

    title: 'The Role of Remote Activities in Urban Mobility in the Post-COVID-19 Era',
    summary: 'This study examines how remote activities, particularly teleworking and tele-education have been associated with urban mobility patterns in Greece during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing on shifts in travel behavior and attitudes toward future mobility trends, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 1,115 respondents, primarily from Thessaloniki’s academic community. The survey assessed mobility habits across three time periods (pre-, during, and post-pandemic), remote activity practices, future intentions, and socio-demographic factors. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were carried out to identify key determinants shaping future mobility and remote activity preferences. Results show significant behavioral changes, with walking, private vehicle, and bus use declining sharply during the pandemic. Prior to COVID-19, 80% of employees had no teleworking experience, yet 60% transitioned to working remotely five or more days weekly at the pandemic’s peak. Findings highlight strong support for continuing telework and remote learning post-pandemic, indicating lasting shifts in work, education, and urban mobility patterns.',

    title: 'The Effectiveness of 3D Virtual Environments for BPMN Teaching: A Quasi-Experimental Study',
    summary: 'Traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, being static and highly abstract, often hinder comprehension, particularly for novice designers and students. This can lead to misinterpretations and process inefficiencies. In this study, we investigate whether immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments can enhance the understanding of BPMN models. We developed a virtual reality (VR)-based BPMN visualization tool and conducted a quasi -experiment with 48 academic and professional participants, who interacted with a 3D BPMN model using Google Cardboard and a joystick. Participants completed comprehension tasks before and after the VR experience. The results show significant improvements in understanding and engagement, suggesting that immersive virtual reality can be a valuable educational tool for BPMN learning. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the integration of 3D environments in process modeling education, offering benefits for both academic and professional training.',

    title: 'Waste for Knowledge: An IoT-Driven Educational Reward System',
    summary: 'Wastes should not be wasted - it might be opportunities for a brighter future. That is the idea behind Waste4Knowledge, an IoT-driven kiosk that turns discarded items like plastic bottle aluminum cans into opportunities for children to learn and grow. The system incentivizes children to recycle waste materials by rewarding them with items, stationeries, or access to education contents. It uses IoT sensors and an ESP32 microcontroller to check the recyclables and hand out rewards without a hitch. Its modular hardware design, combined with Firebase software, allows real-time data tracking, enabling administrators to analyze recycling trends, adjust reward strategies, and optimize the user experience dynamically. By integrating recycling and education, the W4K system offers opportunities to underprivileged children, fosters environmental responsibility, and inspires positive community behavior. Its adaptable design positions it as a scalable solution for sustainable development initiatives worldwide.',

    title: 'Tech-Enhanced Learning: Evaluating General Education in Vocational Colleges Through Technology Integration',
    summary: 'In vocational education, the role of general education (GE) is pivotal in cultivating a well-rounded skill set among students. As the demands of the job market evolve, it becomes imperative to assess and enhance the efficacy of GE in these specialized settings. Vocational colleges (VC) and higher vocational institutions are essential in getting pupils ready for careers by offering specialized courses. However, the significance of GE cannot be overstated, as it provides a foundation for critical thinking, communication skills, and a broad intellectual perspective. This investigation aims to investigate the evaluation system of GE and related courses within VCs and higher vocational institutions. The study employs a descriptive mixed-methods approach. A purposive sampling technique was utilized to select participants. Using a questionnaire survey and interview method, the data for this paper was gathered from 157 teachers and 208 students. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS for statistical analysis. The findings identified that integrating technology-based evaluation methods enhances the effectiveness of GE programs in VCs. The result clarified that regular feedback and assessment in GE courses in higher VCs lead to better retention and understanding of the course content. The novelty of the study lies in assessing GE and courses in vocational and higher VCs, by exploring unique evaluation systems, it aims to enhance the quality of education, aligning curriculum with industry demands, and promoting well-rounded graduates in vocational settings.',

    title: 'Assessing the role of artificial intelligence in quality of legal education with special reference to sustainable development goal',
    summary: 'The transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly apparent in a variety of fields, including legal education. This study investigates the potential of AI in transforming legal education in order to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), 2030. As nations and cultures global struggle to achieve the SDGs, legal professionals play an important role in establishing legal frameworks that support progress toward these goals. It can improve the delivery of legal curricula by providing customized learning experiences targeted to individuals. AI can also help educators to create current content and enhance the evaluation. Education is now more dynamic, accessible, and affordable, expanding its reach. Quality of legal education is a cornerstone of achieving the SDGs set for 2030. The effective utilization of AI in the field of legal education holds significant promise in not only expanding access but also improving the quality of legal education. AI-powered legal research tools have the potential to revolutionize legal research for law students, researchers, and legal practitioners. They can provide more efficient and comprehensive ways to explore legal precedents, case law, and statutes, thus empowering legal professionals to perform their duties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By improving access to legal information, these tools can play a significant role in the formulation of laws and regulations that align with the SDGs. This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which AI can contribute to advancing legal education and, consequently, supporting the attainment of the SDGs.',

    summary: 'Während sich in den letzten Jahren verschiedene Wissenschaftler:innen mit der Inklusion und dem Bildungserfolg von Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen auseinandergesetzt haben, bleibt die Frage, was diese selbst unter Studienerfolg verstehen, weitgehend außer Acht. Das erste Ziel dieses Artikels ist es, die Konzeptionen von Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Schlüsselfaktoren zu analysieren, die zum Hochschulerfolg von 28 Absolvent:innen mit Beeinträchtigung aus 16 deutschen Hochschulen beigetragen haben. Das zweite Ziel besteht darin, Empfehlungen zu geben, die die Teilnehmenden selbst an andere Studierende mit Beeinträchtigung sowie an die Hochschulen richten, um ihren Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung zu verbessern. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Teilnehmenden unterschiedliche Konzeptionen von Erfolg haben (Erreichen eines Abschlusses, gute Noten, Erlernen und Entwickeln von Fähigkeiten, Sammeln von praktischen Erfahrungen, Überwinden von Herausforderungen und Aufrechterhalten eines Gleichgewichts zwischen Studium und Gesundheit) sowie verschiedene persönliche Faktoren (die Behinderung als treibende Kraft) und kontextuelle Faktoren (soziales und familiäres Umfeld, Auslandsaufenthalte, positives Feedback, Anerkennung von Leistungen und zugängliche Online-Kurse und digitalisierte Materialien) als relevant für ihren Erfolg identifizierten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ferner, dass es für den Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Stärkung von Studierenden mit Beeinträchtigung entscheidend ist, die Stimmen von Absolvent:innen mit Behinderung zu hören. While various researchers have explored inclusion and the educational success of people with impairments in recent years, the question of what the latter mean by academic success remains understudied. The first aim of this article is to analyse the conceptualisations of success in higher education and the key factors that contributed to the academic success of 28 graduates with impairments from 16 German universities. The second aim is to provide recommendations from the participants themselves to other students with impairments and to higher education institutions for improving their success in higher education. The results show that the participants have different conceptualisations of success (achieving a degree, getting good grades, learning and developing skills, gaining practical experience, overcoming challenges and maintaining a balance between studies and health) and identified various personal factors (the disability as a driving force) and contextual factors (social and family environment, time abroad, positive feedback, recognition of achievements and accessible online courses and digitised materials), as relevant to their success. The findings further demonstrate that hearing the voices of graduates with impairments is critical to their success in higher education and the empowerment of students with disabilities.',

    title: 'Supplementation Matters: Academic Impact of an Afterschool Tutoring Program in Timor-Leste',
    summary: 'Students in Timor-Leste face low educational outcomes due to sociopolitical factors rooted in the nation’s colonial history. This study evaluates the academic impact of a low-resource afterschool supplementary tutoring program designed to address learning gaps and improve school outcomes across rural and urban settings. Using instructional design principles, the program employed worksheet-based individualized learning content in a familiar language, supported by personalized feedback. Pre- and post-test scores in mathematics and English were compared over 7 months between an intervention group and a comparison group, with results analyzed using a Welch t test. Findings revealed statistically significant improvements in both subjects, with greater gains in mathematics, suggesting an opportunity to explore alternative methods for English instruction, such as incorporating social interactions to support early learners. The study highlights the importance of community support, tutors’ capabilities, and their residence within local neighborhoods in sustaining the program. These results demonstrate the potential of well-structured afterschool programs to enhance educational outcomes in low-resource contexts, offering a scalable model for similar initiatives in emerging nations.',

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. These instructional strategies aim to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a tool that can promote substantive student involvement and meaningful learning. (An initial draft of this abstract was produced by ChatGPT 4.0, but GenAI was not used in any other way for this article, other than as an interactive partner within the excerpts as clearly marked.)',

    title: 'Informationssuchverhalten und digitale Gesundheitskompetenz von Schüler*innen in Deutschland während der Coronapandemie',
    summary: 'Hintergrund Während der Coronapandemie waren Schüler*innen mit einer Flut von Informationen zur Gesundheit und zur Coronapandemie konfrontiert. Der adäquate Umgang mit Gesundheitsinformationen setzt (digitale) Gesundheitskompetenz voraus. Ziel des Beitrags ist daher, das Informationssuchverhalten und das Ausmaß der digitalen Gesundheitskompetenz (dGK) von Schüler*innen in Deutschland während der Coronapandemie unter Berücksichtigung ihres sozialen Hintergrunds zu analysieren. Material und Methoden Die Online-Befragung wurde während des dritten Lockdowns, von März bis Juli 2021, in Hessen und anderen Bundesländern durchgeführt. Der Feldzugang erfolgte in weiterführenden Schulen, Verbänden und Sportvereinen. Der Online-Fragebogen wurde von N  = 1096 Schüler*innen der Klassenstufe 6 bis 13 aufgerufen und n  = 361 Schüler*innen vollständig ausgefüllt. Es wurden das gesundheitsbezogene Informationssuchverhalten (internetbasierte Quellen für Gesundheitsinformationen, [digitale] Quellen für Informationen zur Coronapandemie), die dGK (Digital Health Literacy Instrument [DHLI]) sowie soziodemografische und -ökonomische Hintergrundmerkmale (Geschlecht, Alter, zuhause gesprochene Sprache, Schulform, subjektiver Sozialstatus) erfasst und mittels uni-, bi- und multivariater Analysen mit SPSS ausgewertet. Ergebnisse Nach Gesundheitsinformationen zum Coronavirus im Internet suchten regelmäßig 75,6 % der Schüler*innen. Schwierigkeiten beim Umgang mit digitalen Gesundheitsinformationen gaben 52,6 % der Schüler*innen an. 49,8 % der Schüler*innen berichteten von Schwierigkeiten beim Bewerten der Zuverlässigkeit von digitalen Informationen zum Coronavirus. Die bi- und multivariaten Analysen weisen darauf hin, dass sich die dGK nach dem subjektiven Sozialstatus (SSS) dahingehend unterscheidet, dass Schüler*innen mit niedrigem bzw. mittlerem SSS (OR = 2,57, 95 %-KI: 1,30–5,06, p  = 0,006) häufiger Schwierigkeiten im Umgang mit digitalen Gesundheitsinformationen zur Coronapandemie aufweisen als Gleichaltrige der Vergleichsgruppen. Die dGK unterscheidet sich nicht signifikant nach soziodemografischen (Geschlecht, Migrationshintergrund) und weiteren sozialen Merkmalen (besuchte Schulform, familiärer Wohlstand). Schlussfolgerung Die Förderung der dGK von Schüler*innen auf Schul- und Individualebene stellt ein wichtiges Anliegen der Prävention und Gesundheitsförderung dar. Durch bildungspolitische Maßnahmen (z. B. durch den „Medienkompetenzrahmen“ für die schulischen Medienbildung in den Bundesländern) sollte es den Schulen ermöglicht werden, die (d)GK im Rahmen der Medien- und Gesundheitsbildung in den Unterricht, Curricula und auf allen Ebenen von und bei allen Akteuren in Schulen (bspw. durch die organisationale Gesundheitskompetenz) zu berücksichtigen. Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, schoolchildren were confronted with a flood of information on health and the coronavirus. Adequate handling of health information requires (digital) health literacy (dHL). The aim of this article is therefore to analyse the information-seeking behaviour and the extent of dHL of schoolchildren in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic according to their social background. Materials and methods The online survey was conducted during the third lockdown, from March–July 2021, in Hesse and other German federal states. Students in secondary schools, associations and sports clubs were contacted. The online questionnaire was accessed by N  = 1096 schoolchildren in grades 6–13 and n  = 361 schoolchildren completed it in full. Health-related information-seeking behaviour (internet-based sources for health information, [digital] sources for information on the COVID-19 pandemic), dHL (Digital Health Literacy Instrument [DHLI]) as well as sociodemographic and socioeconomic background characteristics (gender, age, language spoken at home, type of school, subjective social status) were recorded and evaluated using uni-, bi- and multivariate analyses with SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Results In all, 75.6% of schoolchildren regularly searched for digital health information about the coronavirus. 52.6% of the schoolchildren reported difficulties in dealing with digital health information. 49.8% of the schoolchildren reported difficulties in assessing the reliability of digital information on the coronavirus. The bi- and multivariate analyses indicated that the dHL differs according to subjective social status (SSS) in that those students with low or medium SSS (odds ratio = 2.57, 95% confidence interval 1.30–5.06, p  = 0.006) more frequently have difficulties in dealing with digital health information on the COVID-19 pandemic than their peers in the comparison groups. The dHL did not differ significantly according to sociodemographic (gender, migration background) and other social characteristics (type of school attended, family wealth). Conclusion Promotion of (d)HL among schoolchildren at school and individual level is an important issue for prevention and health promotion. Educational policy measures (e.g. in the form of “media literacy frameworks” for school media education in the federal states) should enable schools to take (d)HL into account in the context of media and health education in lessons, curricula and at all levels of and among all actors in schools (e.g. through organisational health literacy).',

    title: 'Normative study of the Taiwanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in community-dwelling individuals in Taiwan.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) may not be appropriately interpreted in Taiwan because of the lack of large-scale normative data. Moreover, examinees' demographic characteristics may influence their MoCA scores. However, previous studies have not adequately adjusted for these effects. This study aimed to use regression-based methods to establish demographically adjusted MoCA norms.\n" +
      'METHODS: Participants were recruited from six hospitals and neighboring communities from all geographic areas of Taiwan. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to quantify the effects of age, education, and sex on MoCA total and domain scores, resulting in correction equations and adjusted cutoff scores.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 2,310 cognitively healthy participants were included in the analysis. Age and education significantly affected the total and all domain scores. Sex affected naming, language, and abstract thinking domain scores. Correction equations and corresponding cutoffs were proposed for MoCA total and domain scores to support more precise clinical interpretations.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This study provides regression-adjusted norms for the MoCA, improving its accuracy and clinical utility in Taiwan. An adjusted total MoCA score of 23 points is recommended as the cutoff for identifying potential cognitive impairment, with domain-specific cutoffs further supporting individualized interpretation.',

    title: 'Breast Disease Patterns Among Patients Presenting for Mammography in a Major Hospital in the Volta Region of Ghana: A Five-Year Descriptive Retrospective Study.',
    abstract: " The practice of mammography has transitioned from analog to digital with improved accuracy and significant changes to findings. This study was aimed at investigating the current patterns of breast diseases among women presenting for mammography at a major hospital in the Volta region of Ghana.  This descriptive retrospective study reviewed 508 mammography and complimentary breast ultrasound reports conducted between October 2019 and May 2023. Because they were incomplete and had essential patient data missing, 28 reports ( = 28) were excluded. Data extracted from the reports included patients' age, clinical indication, breast density, imaging impression, and BI-RADS classification for each breast. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 26, and results are presented using descriptive and inferential statistics.  The study involved 480 women, aged 40-86 years (mean = 54.6 ± 10.1). The distribution of the breast densities of the women was as follows: almost entirely fatty ( = 79, 16.46%), scattered areas of fibroglandular density ( = 226, 47.08%), heterogeneously dense ( = 145, 30.21%), and extremely dense ( = 30, 6.25%). There was a statistically significant association between age and breast density ( < 0.01). While 30 (6.25%) of the women presented for screening, 450 (93.75%) presented for diagnostic mammography. Breast pain ( = 189, 39.38%), breast lump/mass ( = 155, 32.29%), and suspected breast cancer ( = 47, 9.79%) were the most common clinical indications. The study recorded a total of 960 BI-RADS classifications of which 261 (27.19%) were negative and 699 (72.81%) were positive. Most of the positive findings ( = 521, 74.54%) were BI-RADS 2 and 3. Both benign and suspicious for malignancy or highly suggestive of malignancy lesions were common across women aged 40-50 years. There was a statistically significant association between age and BI-RADS classification ( < 0.01).  This study showed that most of the women presented for diagnostic mammography. Attendance for screening mammography was poor among women presenting for mammography at the hospital; hence, women should be encouraged through health education and other campaign strategies to undergo screening mammography more regularly to facilitate more timely detection and diagnosis of breast diseases. A third of the women in our study had dense breasts. The vast majority of the women had positive findings, but the majority of these findings were indicative of benign breast diseases.",

    title: 'Assessing Knowledge of Radiation Protection and Safety Among Undergraduate and Intern Radiologic Technologists: A Pre- and Post-Educational Course Survey.',
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Radiation protection aims to reduce unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation, protecting patients and healthcare workers. Although diagnostic imaging techniques contribute minimally to overall exposure, risks still exist. Radiologic technologists perform X-ray procedures in diverse settings, collaborating with medical teams to ensure quality patient care. The Radiological Sciences program delivers comprehensive education and clinical training in anatomy, radiation safety, patient positioning, and imaging techniques. This study assesses the effectiveness of educational interventions in enhancing students' understanding of principles of radiation physics, protection, and safety guidelines, preparing them for responsible clinical and research practices.\n" +
      "METHODS: A cross-sectional, in-person survey was conducted among undergraduate and intern students in the Radiological Sciences Department at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) in Jeddah. The Healthcare Professional Knowledge of Radiation Protection (HPKRP) scale was distributed via Google Forms. Data were analyzed using SPSS (v.29). Differences in HPKRP components between students' stages were examined using an unpaired samples -test and ANOVA.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Undergraduate students in their third and fourth years, as well as interns who completed post-educational courses, scored significantly higher than second-year students without prior coursework in medical radiation imaging. Participants with post-educational courses and training in ionizing radiation demonstrated the highest knowledge levels in radiation physics, biology, and principles of radiation use (mean: 9.2 ± 0.8), followed by radiation protection (mean: 8.9 ± 1.2). Knowledge of safe ionizing radiation use guidelines scored slightly lower (mean: 8.5 ± 1.6).\n' +

    title: 'The association between the dietary index for gut microbiota and its components with cardiovascular disease risk: a cross-sectional study based on NHANES.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and its development and progression are closely associated with diet-induced changes in gut microbiota. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) and its components, including the beneficial gut microbiota score (BGMS) and the unfavorable gut microbiota score (UGMS), in relation to cardiovascular disease.\n' +
      'METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (1999-2020), collecting baseline sociodemographic and health-related data from 41,193 adults aged ≥20 years. We constructed multivariable weighted logistic regression models to evaluate associations between DI-GM, BGMS, UGMS, and CVD risk, generating weighted restricted cubic spline (RCS) plots to visualize dose-response relationships. Subgroup analyses assessed outcome robustness across sex, age, hypertension, and diabetes subgroups.\n' +
      'RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders (age, sex, race, poverty-to-income ratio [PIR index], marital status, and education level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index [BMI], and comorbidities), significant associations emerged between DI-GM, BGMS, and CVD risk. Increasing DI-GM and BGMS levels showed gradually decreasing CVD risk trends (DI-GM: OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-1.00,  < 0.05; BGMS: OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88-0.96,  < 0.05). No significant association was found between UGMS and CVD risk (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99-1.08,  > 0.05). Subgroup analyses revealed more significant DI-GM and BGMS associations with CVD risk in female versus male participants ( for interaction < 0.05).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Among adults aged ≥20 years, DI-GM and BGMS showed significant inverse association with CVD risk. Compared to DI-GM, BGMS demonstrates a stronger inverse association with cardiovascular disease risk. These findings underscore the potential crucial role of favorable dietary patterns in cardiovascular disease prevention.',

    title: "The relationship between vitamin D levels and Alzheimer's disease risk: insights from a centenarian study of Chinese women.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: While vitamin D₃ (VD₃) has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention, limited evidence exists among centenarians-particularly women-who exhibit unique cognitive aging trajectories. This study aimed to examine the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and AD risk in Chinese female centenarians.\n" +
      'METHODS: We included 514 female participants aged ≥100 years from the China Healthy Longevity Multicenter Study (CHLMS). AD was diagnosed using education-adjusted MMSE thresholds and clinical exclusion of non-AD dementias. Serum 25(OH)D and biochemical markers were measured using standardized laboratory protocols. Logistic regression models (unadjusted and progressively adjusted) assessed associations between 25(OH)D and AD. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) and piecewise regressions evaluated non-linear and threshold effects, while subgroup analyses explored effect modification.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Higher serum 25(OH)D levels were independently associated with lower odds of AD (adjusted OR per 1 ng/mL: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.90-1.00;  = 0.037). Compared to the lowest quartile, participants in the highest quartile had an 87% reduced risk (OR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03-0.50;  = 0.007). RCS analysis revealed a significant inverse dose-response relationship, with a potential threshold effect observed at 29.3 ng/mL. Piecewise regression confirmed that the protective association was strongest below this threshold. Subgroup analyses across smoking, hypertension, and early-life indicators showed consistent effects with no significant interactions.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Among Chinese female centenarians, serum vitamin D₃ levels are inversely associated with AD risk in a dose-dependent manner, particularly below 29.3 ng/mL. These findings highlight the relevance of vitamin D₃ as a potentially modifiable factor in cognitive aging and support further interventional studies in the oldest-old population.',

    title: 'Association between obesity indicators and retinopathy in US adults: NHANES 2005-2008.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Obesity is harmful to the retina. Few studies have examined obesity indicators for retinopathy, and our research is intended to elucidate this relationship.\n' +
      'METHODS: This study assessed the association between obesity indicators and retinopathy using weighted multifactorial logistic regression, participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The stability of the relationship was tested by subgroup analysis. Moreover, restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to test for a non-linear relationship between them. Finally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to compare the prognostic value of each obesity indicator for retinopathy.\n' +
      'RESULTS: After adjusting the confounding factor, weighted logistic regression showed positive associations between body roundness index (BRI), conicity index (CI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), tri-ponderal mass index (TMI), weight-adjusted-waist index (WWI), body mass index (BMI), and retinopathy. RCS curves found linear correlations between BRI, CI, WHtR, TMI, and WWI with retinopathy, except for BMI. Subgroup analyses showed no significant interactions between age, sex, ethnicity, and education subgroups. ROC curves showed that WWI had the highest predictive value for retinopathy.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Overall, increased levels of these obesity indicators increase the likelihood of developing retinopathy.',

    title: 'An Examination of Public Knowledge of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Almost three million traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are reported in the US annually. Concussions, also known as mild TBIs (mTBIs), are the most common and account for approximately 90% of TBIs annually. Research indicates confusion regarding the (1) symptoms, (2) mechanisms of injury, and (3) treatment and recovery associated with mTBI. This study sought to build upon previous research by investigating mTBI knowledge within these three domains.\n' +
      'MATERIALS AND METHODS: Responses from 529 participants were collected from two groups: college students ( = 333) and the general public ( = 196). Participants completed a self-report questionnaire that included true/false items spanning the three domains of mTBI knowledge.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Overall, mTBI knowledge accuracy was 67%, with highest accuracy on items related to mTBI symptoms (78.77%), followed by mechanisms of injury (71.6%) and treatment and recovery (53.9%). College students had significantly higher mTBI knowledge accuracy, as well as higher accuracy on the mTBI symptom and mechanism items. There were no significant differences in knowledge of mTBI treatment and recovery between groups.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: This study highlights the importance of mTBI education following an mTBI diagnosis. Explanations for these findings considering demographic and individual differences are provided, and clinical implications are discussed.',

    title: 'Assessing Racial and Gender Disparities in Asthma Education, Knowledge, and Healthcare Access Among Adolescents.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Asthma is the most common chronic disease among adolescents, yet disparities exist in its diagnosis and management across racial and gender groups. This study aims to assess asthma knowledge, awareness, and healthcare access among adolescents, with a focus on racial and gender disparities. The goal is to identify gaps in asthma education and knowledge, as well as other barriers that may contribute to the underdiagnosis of asthma within these groups.\n' +
      "PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey included adolescents aged 10-18 years, with responses collected through Qualtrics. A total of 90 participants were selected, with no restrictions based on asthma status. Written informed consent was obtained from parents of participants under 18, while participants who were 18 years old provided their own written consent in accordance with IRB guidelines. Participants' knowledge of asthma symptoms, triggers, and healthcare access was assessed using multiple-choice and Likert scale questions. Data were analyzed for demographic differences in asthma knowledge and healthcare access across racial and gender groups.\n" +
      'RESULTS: The study found that asthma education was minimal, with only 8% of participants reporting prior formal asthma education. Despite this, 53.4% of participants considered themselves knowledgeable about asthma, 59.5% could identify three or more asthma symptoms, and 50.6% identified more than three triggers. Racial disparities were evident, with Asian adolescents having a significantly lower asthma diagnosis rate compared to other racial groups (6.5% vs 47.4%, P<0.01), a lower rate of self-reported asthma knowledge (45.1% vs 64.9%, P=0.08), and lower odds of finding healthcare access "extremely easy" (OR=0.179, 95% CI: 0.076-0.455, P=0.00018). Although there was no difference in the rate of previous asthma diagnoses, males were more likely to seek medical help compared to females (OR=2.55, 95% CI: 1.037-6.268, P=0.032).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This study highlights significant gaps in asthma education, perception of healthcare access, and healthcare seeking behaviour particularly among Asian adolescents and females, and underscores the need for targeted interventions to address racial and gender disparities in asthma diagnosis and care.',

    title: 'Prevalence and Correlates of Behavioural Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases Among Allied Health Undergraduate Students in Ghana: A Cross-Sectional Study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND AIM: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are noninfectious diseases mostly marked by complex aetiology with different risk factors. They develop from an interplay between modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, which are of great concern to the public as they mostly lead to varied metabolic changes. This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of behavioural risk factors of non-communicable diseases among undergraduate allied health students in Ghana.\n' +
      'METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that used a pretested and structured questionnaire to collect data from 228 participants. The data was analysed using SPSS. Logistic regressions and Chi-squared tests were employed to assess the associations between sociodemographic factors and each NCD risk factor. Statistical significance was set at  ≤ 0.05.\n' +
      'RESULTS: About 87.3% of undergraduate allied health students practised unhealthy dietary patterns. Only 45.2% were physically active. Being a Nonresident student was associated with drinking alcohol (OR = 2.5; 95%CI = 1.1-5.9). Male undergraduate students were less likely to be physically inactive (OR = 0.4; 95%CI = 0-0.9) while community nutrition students were less likely to engage in unhealthy diet practices (OR = 0.7; 95%CI = 0.2-1.3). Female proportions among those with one (60.7%,  = 0.02) and two (61.9%,  = 0.01) risk factors were high. A greater portion of the students with unhealthy dietary (81.4%,  = 0.032) and physical inactivity (69.5%,  = 0.010) patterns were 18-24 years old. Most participants with one (61.8%,  = 0.04) and two (69.5%,  < 0.001) behavioural risk factors were all 18-24 years old.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: The findings of this study highlight a concerning trend of poor dietary habits and physical activity patterns among undergraduate allied health students. Despite being future healthcare professionals, these students exhibited suboptimal behaviours that can negatively impact their own health and well-being, as well as their ability to provide effective health promotion and education to their future patients. Healthcare educators and administrators should recognize the importance of promoting a healthy campus environment that supports students' physical and mental well-being.",
