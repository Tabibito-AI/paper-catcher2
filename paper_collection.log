    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +
      'national income model, government-purchases multiplier and tax multiplier.',

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +
      'propensity for educational attainment have been constructed. It is by now well\n' +
      'established that this PGS predicts wages, income, and occupational prestige and\n' +
      'occupational mobility across generations. It is unknown whether a PGS for\n' +
      'educational attainment can predict upward income and occupational mobility even\n' +
      'within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin\n' +
      'Longitudinal Study (WLS), I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment\n' +
      'predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when\n' +
      'respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about\n' +
      '53 years of age), conditional on 1974 values of these variables and a range of\n' +
      'covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status,\n' +
      'is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is\n' +
      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +
      'our understanding of longitudinal inequality and shed light on the sources of\n' +
      'heterogeneity in responses to economic shocks and policy.',

    summary: 'We consider the use of Quantifier Elimination (QE) technology for automated\n' +
      "reasoning in economics. QE dates back to Tarski's work in the 1940s with\n" +
      'software to perform it dating to the 1970s. There is a great body of work\n' +
      'considering its application in science and engineering but we show here how it\n' +
      'can also find application in the social sciences. We explain how many suggested\n' +
      'theorems in economics could either be proven, or even have their hypotheses\n' +
      'shown to be inconsistent, automatically; and describe the application of this\n' +
      'in both economics education and research. We describe a bank of QE examples\n' +
      'gathered from economics literature and note the structure of these are, on\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +
      'education. In this paper, we show that the predictive power of this proxy\n' +
      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +
      'propose a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of\n' +
      'education and remains as a significant predictor of economic growth when tested\n' +
      'with both cross-section data and panel data. We argue that future research on\n' +
      'economic growth will discard educational variables based on quantity as\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +
      'Linear amplification yields S-functions as only analytic solutions.\n' +
      'Destructible physical capital controls medium-term recoveries from disaster.\n' +
      'Indestructible human capacity controls the collective long-term industrial\n' +
      'evolution. It is immune even to world wars and runs from 1800 to date parallel\n' +
      'to the unisex life expectancy in the pioneering nations. This is the first\n' +
      'quantitative information on long-term demand. The theory is self-consistent. It\n' +
      'reproduces all peaceful data from 1800 to date without adjustable parameter. It\n' +
      'has full forecasting power since the decisive parameters are constants of the\n' +
      'human species. They predict an asymptotic maximum for the economic level per\n' +

    title: 'Applications of a constrained mechanics methodology in economics',
    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +
      'physics education. The aim of the paper is: 1. to meet the demand for\n' +
      'illustrative examples suitable for presenting the background of the highly\n' +
      'expanding research field of econophysics even on the undergraduate level and 2.\n' +
      'to enable the students to understand deeper the principles and methods\n' +
      'routinely used in mechanics by looking at the well known methodology from the\n' +
      'different perspective of economics. Two constrained dynamic economic problems\n' +
      'are presented using the economic terminology in an intuitive way. First, the\n' +
      'Phillips model of business cycle is presented as a system of forced\n' +
      'oscillations and the general problem of two interacting economies is solved by\n' +
      'the nonholonomic dynamics approach. Second, the Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey model of\n' +
      'economical growth is solved as a variational problem with a velocity dependent\n' +
      'constraint using the vakonomic approach. The specifics of the solution\n' +
      'interpretation in economics compared to mechanics is discussed in detail, a\n' +
      'discussion of the nonholonomic and vakonomic approaches to constrained problems\n' +
      'in mechanics and economics is provided and an economic interpretation of the\n' +
      'Lagrange multipliers (possibly surprising for the students of physics) is\n' +

    summary: 'Massive open online courses (MOOCs) promise to make rigorous higher education\n' +

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: "Factors influencing healthcare workers' vaccine recommendations: A cross-sectional study in Zhejiang Province, China.",
    abstract: "To investigate factors influencing vaccine recommendations by healthcare workers (HCWs) in Zhejiang Province, China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 569 HCWs to assess their beliefs and attitudes toward vaccines, vaccine recommendations and barriers to recommending vaccinations. Logistic regression was utilized to analyze influencing factors. Most participants (89.4%) believed that vaccines can effectively protect children's health. Higher professional titles (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.03-1.50) and increased vaccine confidence (aOR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.05-1.16) were positively associated with vaccine recommendation behaviors, while increased vaccine risk perception significantly reduced recommendations (aOR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78-0.90). Moreover, vaccine hesitancy among HCWs was primarily driven by two main factors: safety concerns regarding immunization (60.8%) and cognitive biases related to vaccine necessity and efficacy (25.8%). This study elucidates professional title advancement and vaccine confidence as critical determinants of vaccine recommendation behaviors among HCWs in Zhejiang Province, China. To improve vaccine acceptance and achieve higher immunization coverage, targeted vaccine education and confidence-building programs should be integrated into HCWs' professional training.",

    title: 'Comparing Approaches to Teaching Patients How to Use an App-Based Home Spirometer: Randomized Controlled Trial.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Bluetooth-enabled, app-based home spirometry has been validated for use in the diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory disease. Remote teaching (virtual or self-directed) of patients on how to use an app-based home spirometry offers the opportunity to deliver diagnostics safely and at scale. However, the most appropriate method of teaching home spirometry to patients is unknown.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pragmatic study undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic was to determine whether virtual or self-directed teaching were valid methods for deploying home spirometry to patients referred for outpatient lung physiology testing.\n' +
      "METHODS: REACH-SPIRO is a single-center, unblinded, randomized controlled trial of adults referred for spirometry. Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to be taught to use a Bluetooth, app-based spirometer either (A) face-to-face, (B) virtually (live video conferencing), or (C) self-directed. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were recorded. Home spirometry (Spirobank Smart Spirometer) readings for each training modality were compared with gold standard hospital measurements (Vyaire Medical) using Bland-Altman Limits of Agreement (LoA). Patients' feedback questionnaires on acceptability and adherence were also collected, and common themes were described using content analysis.\n" +
      'RESULTS: A total of 106 participants were randomized. Bland-Altman analysis between hospital and home FEV1 measurements for group A showed a mean difference of 0.108L, LoA -0.331L to 0.548L, group B 0.152L, LoA -0.358L to 0.661L, and group C 0.153L, LoA -0.358L to 0.661L. FVC measurements in group A showed a mean difference of 0.123L, LoA -0.402L to 0.648L, group B 0.249L, LoA -0.297L to 0.795L, and group C 0.340L, LoA -0.556L to 1.235L. There was no significant difference between randomized arms for either mean FEV1 (P=.41) or FVC (P=.84). Patient feedback was similar across all groups, with more positive feedback for face-to-face and virtual teaching methods.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: There is no meaningful difference in spirometry measurement between patients taught to use a home spirometer remotely (virtual or self-directed) versus traditional face-to-face treatment. Patients' feedback was favorable to all three methods of teaching. This study supports the use of either virtual or self-directed teaching of home spirometry for the monitoring of respiratory disease. In doing so, we can improve access to spirometry in communities facing barriers to health care and clinically vulnerable populations.",

      'RESULTS: The study included 594 patients, with 73.4% arriving outside the recommended window. Women represented one-third of the population overall and 20% in Group A. Younger patients arrived sooner (P < 0.0001). The main reason for delays was a lack of awareness of stroke symptoms (53.2%), followed by initial care sought at non-stroke-ready hospitals (23%). Use of ambulances and vehicle ownership significantly correlated with faster arrivals (P < 0.0001), while distance to the hospital did not significantly affect timeliness. Though most of the variables showed statistical significance between those coming to the hospital within and outside the four-and-a-half hour window with univariate analysis, none of the variables showed a significant association when subjected to logistic regression.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Delays in stroke treatment are a major concern, linked to factors like age, gender, and transportation issues. No single factor independently predicted early hospital arrival. To improve outcomes, we need strategies that enhance public education, symptom recognition, and transportation-especially for vulnerable groups like women and the elderly.',

    title: 'Association of Poverty Income Ratio with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease and Liver Fibrosis Among US Population.',
    abstract: 'Background/Aims: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) represents a recent update in defining fatty liver disease, emphasizing its strong connection to metabolic factors and reflecting a shift in understanding its causes and progression. The principal aim of this investigation was to scrutinize the conceivable association between the poverty income ratio (PIR) and the incidence of MASLD, specifically focusing on liver fibrosis. Materials and Methods: In this study, a cross-sectional analysis was carried out utilizing data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset covering the period from 2017 to 2020. To explore the relationship between the PIR and the prevalence of MASLD as well as liver fibrosis, a robust multivariable analytical method was adopted. This approach integrated a wide range of variables, such as sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, and individual health conditions. Results: In this study, a comprehensive analysis was conducted using logistic regression models and found a significant decline in the likelihood of MASLD in the highest PIR quartile (Q4) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.634, 95% CI: 0.446-0.903, P = .012) as well as liver fibrosis (OR = 0.682, 95% CI: 0.503-0.925, P = .014). Conclusion: The findings obtained from this research strongly demonstrate that higher PIR levels are significantly associated with a reduced prevalence of both MASLD and liver fibrosis, suggesting that higher socioeconomic shighertatus, as reflected by higher PIR, may decrease the risk of these conditions. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions, such as better nutrition education, lifestyle support, and healthcare access to reduce the MASLD burden in low-income populations.',

    abstract: "The Indian Health System, which includes the Indian Health Service, Tribal health systems, and the Urban Indian Health Program, trains fewer resident physicians than would be expected based on its user population. Investment in equitable graduate medical education could address the Indian Health System's shortage of physicians, which could in turn strengthen health operations and improve health outcomes. Several federal and grassroots initiatives offer opportunities for residency program development and implementation, but substantial barriers limit widespread growth of residencies. To inform leaders and educators, the authors review the relevant context of the Indian Health System, outline the key facilitators of the physician residencies currently based there, and describe the considerations relevant to future expansion.",

    title: 'Educational Activity with Guatemalan Lay Midwives about Helping Babies Breath.',
    abstract: "Reason. Guatemala's Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) of 18 deaths per 100,000 live births was 17th highest in the world in 2020. One contributor is lay midwives, who attend most births at home and often lack education about helping babies breathe (HBB). An educational activity that incorporated cultural humility was provided orally in the native language of participants about HBB. The educational activity was provided in the most remote department with some of the worst health outcomes in the country. Demographic and quality improvement data were collected. A pretest posttest was used to evaluate if the educational activity changed participants' knowledge. Findings. A t test showed a statistically significant change in knowledge from pretest (n=195, M=2.64, SD=1.27) to posttest (n=195, M=4.22, SD=1.37), 95% Confidence Interval, p=.0001. Conclusion. Educational activities for vulnerable populations with low literacy should be provided orally in the native language of participants and should be designed with cultural humility to maximize knowledge improvement.",

    abstract: 'This study examines health care service utilization of adults impacted by the justice system (n=3380) and general patient population (n=226,970) receiving care at one federally qualified health center (FQHC; n=62 service sites) in California between 2020-2022. A hybrid manual review of the electronic medical record was conducted. The top five departments used by adults impacted by the justice system, based on total number of encounters, were general medicine, case management, mental health services, specialty services, and substance use disorder services. Patients demonstrated vulnerabilities in education, employment, and housing and extensive use of clinical services. Adults impacted by the justice system can benefit from targeted and coordinated case management to support health care utilization. Findings may inform funding initiatives, staffing, and service delivery models to optimize care and support services for individuals who have experienced contact with the justice system.',
