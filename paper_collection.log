    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    abstract: 'ABSTRACT In this paper we ask, what is mainstream economics education conveying to its students? Standard mainstream economics textbooks treat the environment as a specialist issue in addition to standard concerns and based on solutions that conform to those standard concerns. When viewed as socialisation for students this is a major problem. To illustrate the problems we set out key aspects of the standard format, and draw attention to the structure and contents from two well-known textbooks. Standard textbooks convey the impression that the ‘environmental issue’ is appropriately incorporated and exhibit two complacency-creating features. First, fundamental problems (acute global ecological breakdown, biodiversity loss, climate change crisis etc), issues and urgency cannot be adequately conveyed to students within this way of framing economics. Second, specific theory and policy solutions suggest that the problem is well in hand. We illustrate using the theory of negative externalities.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    title: 'Beyond diplomats: why model uns should be for everyone - to advance education for sustainable development and build capacity for intergovernmental engagement',
    summary: 'Model United Nations (Model UN) simulations have long been hailed as transformative educational experiences, particularly for students pursuing careers in the fields of law, international affairs, or diplomacy. However, their potential to cultivate a diverse array of skills across wider disciplines, and the importance of these disciplines’ participation within UN forums, has often been overlooked. Here, we argue that Model UNs serve as invaluable entry points for students from various academic backgrounds to engage with pressing global issues, develop critical thinking abilities, enhance communication skills, and foster a sense of global citizenship. This ultimately builds intergovernmental literacy and capacity among the wider population, enabling action by a broader suite of societal actors (beyond diplomacy). By critically examining the multifaceted benefits of Model UN participation, this piece advocates for broader recognition and integration of Model UNs across faculties and disciplines within higher education curricula.',

    title: 'Using Computational Grounded Theory to Analyze Pre-service Chemistry Teachers’ Reflective Practice Regarding Technology Integration in Classrooms Within a Service-Learning–Oriented Seminar',
    summary: 'Integrating digital technologies in science education requires innovative methods to bridge theoretical knowledge and practical classroom application. This study examines a seminar at an Austrian university that was redesigned to address pre-service chemistry teachers’ professional knowledge regarding technology implementation in high school classes via a service-learning approach. By combining questionnaires with formative evaluation through reflective learning diaries, our study captures the multifaceted nature of professional knowledge acquisition. Central to this work is the use of natural language processing within a Computational Grounded Theory framework to analyze students’ reflective diaries. We employed techniques such as word embeddings and topic modeling to extract latent themes and patterns in student texts. We revealed that, despite mixed results from conventional self-report measures and deductive qualitative content analysis, students’ written reflections offered rich insights into their learning processes when we investigated them through the lens of natural language processing. Along the diary entries, our analysis uncovered shifts in emphasis from, e.g., broad cultural perceptions of teaching and learning to more detailed considerations of lesson planning and technology integration. These nuanced insights underscore the complementary value of natural language processing in identifying underlying patterns of reflective practice that traditional assessments may overlook. Although the study is limited by its small sample size and methodological constraints, the findings suggest that incorporating computational techniques can enhance the formative assessment of free writing in teacher education programs. Overall, the results motivate us to advocate for the integration of computational text analysis as a promising tool in evaluating and fostering the complex interplay of professional knowledge and reflective practice in technology-enhanced science education.',

    title: 'Beyond text in the EFL digital landscape exploring power, identity, and culture in post-COVID-19 online learning communities',
    summary: 'This mixed-methods study investigated the intersection of power, identity, and culture within a post-COVID-19 online English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning community at the college level, focusing on 261 adult learners. Drawing upon critical pedagogy and existing literature on online learning and multiliteracies, the research explored how these factors influenced learners’ multiliteracies development and experiences in the digital landscape. The study addressed a gap in research by focusing on the interplay of these factors in a post-pandemic context. Quantitative data from an online survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlations, and group comparisons. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews (n = 26) and virtual ethnographies (n = 3) underwent thematic analysis, employing inductive and deductive coding followed by constant comparison. Findings revealed a complex interplay of opportunities and challenges. While learners valued the flexibility and intercultural exchange afforded by the online environment, concerns emerged regarding power dynamics, equitable access to technology and resources, and the negotiation of cultural identities. This study highlights the necessity for a critical pedagogical approach that prioritizes inclusivity, digital literacy development, and learner empowerment within online EFL learning communities. Implications suggest that fostering diverse communication methods, cultivating a supportive community culture, and actively bridging the digital divide are crucial for creating equitable and engaging online learning experiences.',

    title: 'Expressions of educational change agents: Student voice influences in higher education',
    summary: 'With the changing paradigms in education, from teacher-centred, student-as-object to student-centred, student-as-subject, student voice discourse has developed at all levels of education, including in higher education (HE). However, the development of student voice research and implementation has tended to prioritise Northern voices over those of colleagues in institutions in the Global South. Incorporating student voice in HE is a journey that all colleagues globally should be and are participating in. This special issue aims to create a space for diverse voices in the field, both from the Global North and South. In addition to expanding student voice discourse geographically, this special issue includes articles in which students act as knowledge producers in student voice discourse (Hu & Lue, 2025), and the voices of neurodivergent students are highlighted (Durgungoz & Durgungoz, 2025). In this special issue, we hope to help fill the geographical and positional ‘minority’ gaps in student voice discourse, making room for future discourse expansion and promoting education as a more collaborative and socially just endeavour.',

    title: 'Exploring the Role of Care in the Teaching Aspirations of Latina Pre-Service Teachers',
    summary: 'In this qualitative study, I center two pre-service Latina teachers who attend a Hispanic-serving institution in a major urban city in the Southwest to illustrate their aspirations to become teachers in their communities. Using “care” as a conceptual lens, I discuss that, besides merely caring about children, these two women were inspired to become teachers because of the care they received from their own teacher(s) thus, in their own future classrooms, they aim to enact culturally affirming and relevant care with students and families. This is an important experience that Latinas bring with them into teacher education and their future classrooms because they understand from lived experiences the contextual factors that contribute to student learning and the need for more critical forms of caring in our urban schools. However, while well-intentioned, this goal of Latina pre-service teachers may perpetuate expectations which often place further taxation and increased roles for them as teachers. Given this implication specific to Latina pre-service teachers, preparation to prevent excessive emotional labor is much-needed in the teacher education field for their persistence.',

    title: 'The compensatory effect of education as revealed by resting-state electroencephalographic alpha rhythms in patients with dementia due to Parkinson’s disease: findings from an exploratory study',
    summary: 'Here, we investigated whether educational attainment influences the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying vigilance regulation, as reflected in resting-state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms, in patients with dementia due to Parkinson’s (PDD) and Lewy body disease (DLB). Clinical, demographic, and rsEEG data were obtained from an international database, including PDD patients ( N  = 75), DLB patients ( N  = 50), and cognitively unimpaired older controls (Healthy; N  = 54). Each group was partitioned into low (Edu-) and high (Edu+) educational attainment subgroups, matched for age, sex, and cognitive-motor status. We analyzed rsEEG rhythms across the individual delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. Cortical rsEEG source topography was estimated using eLORETA freeware. In the Healthy group, Edu+ participants exhibited significantly greater widespread rsEEG alpha source activities compared to Edu- participants, possibly reflecting neuroprotective neurophysiological mechanisms. Conversely, in the PDD group, Edu+ patients showed lower widespread rsEEG alpha source activities than Edu- patients, possibly indicating compensatory mechanisms. No significant differences in rsEEG source activities were observed between DLB-Edu+ and DLB-Edu- patients. Educational attainment may be associated with compensatory mechanisms that counteract the abnormal neurophysiological processes underlying rsEEG alpha rhythms and vigilance regulation in PDD patients, but not in DLB patients. Future studies combining rsEEG and neuroimaging techniques should investigate the metabolic and functional connectivity correlates of these putative compensatory mechanisms in the PDD brain. Early education may be a key investment for national governments, especially in low-income countries, to prevent the cognitive deficits of Parkinson’s disease along aging, thereby reducing the unbearable social and economic burden.',

    title: 'Age equality in mental health: Déjà vu all over again.',
    abstract: 'AIMS: Ageism is one of the last socially accepted prejudices. This paper aims to highlight key areas of age discrimination and inequality in mental health services.\n' +
      "DISCUSSION: It will discuss examples, drawn mainly from the UK, in terms of mental health inequalities to illustrate age inequality. It will define what is meant by 'older people' before discussing ageism and age equality. Examples will be given of the impact of ageism has on the mental health of older people themselves, the impact of institutional ageism on the unequal access older people have to age-appropriate services. Additionally, as older people present differently, their needs are not always recognised. This demonstrates the need for further training and education for health and social care professionals.\n" +
      "CONCLUSION: It will conclude with hope and encouragement for action with possible ideas to take forward to continue to address this. It calls for allies to address 'Everyday Ageism' and will signpost readers to resources that may assist them in their endeavours to challenge this.",

    title: 'Prevalence, symptomology, and correlates of curable sexually transmitted infections among pregnant women in Eastern Cape, South Africa.',
    abstract: 'BackgroundCurable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) contribute to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Syndromic management is standard care in South Africa. We evaluated prevalence, symptomology, and correlates of curable STIs, among pregnant women in Eastern Cape, South Africa.MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis using baseline data from a randomized controlled trial of pregnant women attending their first antenatal care visit at public clinics in Buffalo City Municipality (2021-2024). Participants were tested for , ,  using GeneXpert point-of-care tests and for syphilis using Alere Determine TP rapid test. Symptoms were self-reported and clinically-observed. Adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors.ResultsAmong 1491 participants (median age: 28 years (IQR: 24-33); gestational age: 13 weeks (IQR: 8-18); HIV prevalence: 30%), STI prevalence was 27.6% (95% CI: 25.3-29.9):  14.7%,  5%,  10.2%, syphilis 3.4%. Women with HIV had higher STI prevalence (32.8% vs 25.3%,  = .003), particularly for  (17% vs 7.3%,  < .001); 20.1% of women with C, , and/or  were symptomatic, and 63% of symptomatic women tested STI-negative. Younger age, lower education, multiple sex partners and unknown HIV-serostatus of partners were associated with increased STI prevalence.ConclusionWe observed a high prevalence of STIs, particularly among women with HIV, with many asymptomatic cases; emphasizing the need for integrated point-of-care testing to ensure timely treatment, reduce antibiotic overuse, and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.',

    title: 'Sweat Testing and Cystic Fibrosis - test performance before and after a quality improvement project in a South African tertiary hospital laboratory.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) is challenging due to high quantity not sufficient (QNS) rates of sweat tests, leading to frequent retesting, increasing costs and adverse impacts on patient care. This study aimed to assess sweat test performance and implement a quality improvement project (QIP) to reduce QNS rates.\n' +
      'METHODS: A two-part retrospective audit was conducted. Part one spanned two-years reviewing the two-tiered testing with sweat conductivity as a screening tool, followed by chloride testing. Part two evaluated the QNS rates over two 6-month periods, separated by a QIP, which involved technologist training, clinician education, patient preparation protocols and revised testing procedures.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Over the two-year period: 425 sweat tests were performed on 291 patients. Sweat conductivity testing demonstrated a lower QNS rate, 13% (31/238), compared to sweat chloride testing's 31% (33/105). High QNS rates were observed in younger infants and in malnourished or acutely ill patients. Post-QIP, the QNS rates for the total study population decreased by 5%, from an initial 30% to 25% in the sweat chloride cohort, while the acceptable QNS rate of 12% remained unchanged in the sweat conductivity cohort Conclusion: Achieving target QNS rates remains challenging, especially in younger infants, with improved QNS rates in older infants and children. Recommendations include limiting sweat testing to experienced technologists and ensuring patient readiness.",

    title: "Report on the Evidence-Based Practice Committee's Survey on Benign Neoplastic Hand Disease.",
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate and understand the knowledge and practice patterns of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) members regarding the evidence-based management of benign neoplastic hand diseases (BNHD). The goal is to identify areas of educational deficiency and variability in clinical approaches.\n' +
      'METHODS: In the fall of 2022, a 17-question survey was sent via email to ASSH members. The survey included evidence-based practice (EBP) questions with definitive correct answers, and practice pattern (PP) questions that focused on controversial clinical scenarios without a single correct answer. Responses were collected and analyzed to determine the percentage of correct answers for EBP questions and to identify consensus or variability among PP questions.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Out of 356 respondents, over 50% correctly answered 6 out of 12 EBP questions, indicating a strong knowledge base in certain areas of BNHD management. The remaining six EBP questions revealed knowledge gaps, particularly in the management of giant cell tumors and enchondromas. The PP questions showed variability in practice approaches, reflecting diverse clinical decision making among members.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The survey identified both strengths and areas for improvement in ASSH members' understanding of evidence-based management of BNHD. These findings suggest a need for specific educational initiatives to address knowledge gaps and promote more consistent EBPs within the field of hand surgery.\n" +

    title: '"Too little, too late": youth retrospectives on school attendance problems and professional support received.',
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: School attendance problems (SAPs) are a vexing issue that pose significant challenges for youth, families, and professional stakeholders. Despite growing research efforts, studies that explore the perspectives of youth on SAPs remain limited, particularly in Nordic countries. This qualitative study investigated Norwegian youths' retrospectives on the development and persistence of SAPs and the support they received from professionals in addressing their challenges.\n" +
      'METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 youth (aged 12-22) with a history of SAPs in compulsory education. Participants were recruited by professionals from the educational-psychological service and alternative provisions in three Norwegian municipalities. Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The results indicate that lacking positive relationships with peers and teachers along with falling behind academically lead to school alienation and contributes to the onset or maintenance of SAPs. Similar experiences of gradual onset of SAPs, anxiety and depression, emotional and somatic distress, and conflicting feelings around avoidance were outlined. The youths' initial experiences of support within the school setting were described as inappropriate, insufficient, or initiated too late, while attending alternative provisions appeared as a primary intervention that had enduring positive effects on attendance and engagement in academic and social activities.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the need for early intervention, coherence between initiatives across support services and effective collaboration between youth, families, schools, and external services.',

    title: 'Personality Traits, Stress, Anxiety, Depression Levels, Fear of Childbirth, and Affecting Factors in Turkish University Students.',
    abstract: " This study was conducted to investigate the personality traits, stress, anxiety, depression levels, fear of childbirth, and affecting factors in Turkish female university students.  The study was planned as a descriptive and correlational type. The sample consisted of 500 female students who met the research criteria at the Faculty of Health Sciences and Faculty of Education of a university. The data were collected face-to-face using a personal information form, including socio-demographic and pregnancy-birth-related thoughts, the Childbirth Fear-Prior to Pregnancy (CFPP) scale, the Type D Personality Scale (negative affectivity and social inhibition subscales), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Ethics committee approval and institutional permissions were obtained from the students to conduct the study. In the analysis of the data, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, descriptive methods Mann-Whitney , and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used.  52.8% of the students were from the Faculty of Health Sciences, 48.4% were nursing students, and 30.6% were in their first class of students. The mean CFPP score was 40.14 ± 11.35. The mean score was 12.01 ± 6.79 for negative affectivity, 9.58 ± 6.09 for social inhibition, 6.75 ± 4.05 for stress, 5.28 ± 4.09 for anxiety, and 5.58 ± 4.50 for depression. There was a low level of positive correlation between CFPP and social inhibition subscales ( = 0.113), negative affectivity ( = 0.282), stress ( = 0.241), anxiety ( = 0.231), and depression ( = 0.221 ( = 0.01). The predictor of students' fear of childbirth prior to pregnancy was negative affectivity.  Turkish university students' fear of childbirth prior to pregnancy was associated with personality traits, depression, anxiety, and stress. It is recommended to identify the depression, anxiety, stress levels, personality traits, and fear of childbirth of female university students in the prepregnancy period, plan information and education, and conduct further research on the fear of childbirth.",

    title: 'Awareness, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding OTC Drugs in Circassian and Chechen Communities in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are widely used for self-medication, yet their misuse can lead to adverse outcomes. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, awareness, and attitudes toward OTC drugs among Circassians and Chechens in Jordan.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in September 2022 using an online survey targeting Circassians and Chechens aged 18 and above. The questionnaire was validated by clinical researchers and consisted of demographic data and questions on OTC drug use, awareness, and attitudes. Data from 418 participants were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, with a significant level of p < 0.05.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The majority of participants were female (76.1%), married (78.5%), and almost half of the participants held a non-medical bachelor's degree (49.3%). Analgesics (73.9%) and vitamins (56.7%) were the most used OTC drugs. Headache (65.6%), musculoskeletal pain (33.7%), and the common cold (25.4%) were the primary reasons for self-medication. Most participants (53.8%) expressed strong interest in knowing the side effects and contraindications of OTC drugs, while 72.5% checked expiry dates before use. Notably, 50.2% disagreed with the statement that OTC products have no side effects. Age and educational level were significantly associated with self-medication practices (p < 0.05).\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Circassians and Chechens in Jordan exhibit high awareness of the risks associated with OTC drug use, yet self-medication practices remain prevalent. Public health interventions should focus on education campaigns to mitigate potential misuse and promote safe practices.',

    title: 'Which elective hand surgery would benefit most from preoperative therapy interventions to enhance surgical outcomes? A survey of hand therapists.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: An ageing population and increasing chronic health disorders explain the predicted rise in hand surgeries. Preoperative care has the potential to optimise patients' psychological and physical status, making it a promising area for enhancing surgical outcomes. Despite its established use in other surgical specialties, preoperative therapy in hand surgery remains underexplored.\n" +
      "OBJECTIVE: This study uses an anonymous survey to gather therapists' opinions on the hand procedure whose outcomes benefit most from preoperative therapy. The research focuses on five common elective hand procedures: Carpal Tunnel Release (CTR); Cubital Tunnel Release (CuTR); Dupuytren's Fasciectomy (DF); Trapeziectomy (TZ); and Trigger Finger Release (TFR).\n" +
      'METHOD: British Association of Hand Therapy members were targeted in an online survey. Thirty-seven respondents (5% response rate) participated over 3 months. Questions explored how preoperative therapy improves surgical outcomes, the efficacy of postoperative therapy, and the importance of patient compliance postoperatively.\n' +
      'RESULTS: TZ emerged as the procedure with the highest potential for preoperative therapy benefit, TZ and DF as top procedures for postoperative therapy requirements and importance of patient engagement and compliance. CTR had contradictory responses, while TFR and CuTR received the fewest endorsements for preoperative therapy benefits.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: The survey offers insight into hand therapists' perspectives on preoperative therapy. TZ and DF stand out as having significant potential for optimisation. Uncertainty surrounding efficacy of therapy on Dupuytren's Disease indicates the necessity for further research. Education is considered an essential preoperative component. The small sample size warrants caution when interpreting results.",

    title: 'The Impact of New Weight-Loss Medications on Bariatric Surgery and Surgeon Employment.',
    abstract: 'Obesity continues to pose an urgent public health challenge in the United States, with prevalence among adults and significant associations with chronic conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. While bariatric surgery has established itself as the most effective long-term treatment for severe obesity, delivering consistent weight loss and notable improvements in obesity-related comorbidities, its utilization remains relatively low due to factors such as patient apprehension, access disparities, and insurance limitations. The recent emergence and widespread adoption of potent anti-obesity medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists like semaglutide and dual incretin agonists such as tirzepatide, have created new, non-surgical pathways capable of achieving substantial weight loss outcomes, thus prompting a reevaluation of the traditional obesity treatment landscape. This comprehensive review assesses the contemporary state of bariatric surgery and systematically examines the clinical efficacy, safety, and durability of emerging pharmacotherapies relative to surgical interventions. We also analyze the potential implications of these medications on patient preferences, surgical volumes, healthcare economics, and the bariatric surgery job market within the United States. Recognizing the evolving role of bariatric surgeons, we discuss how the profession may adapt through multidisciplinary care models, integrated pharmacological management, and adjusted surgical training programs. The goal of this manuscript is to inform clinicians, healthcare systems, policymakers, and patients regarding the anticipated impact of novel weight-loss medications on the future direction of obesity care and the professional landscape of bariatric surgery.',
