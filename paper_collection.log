    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +
      'national income model, government-purchases multiplier and tax multiplier.',

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'established that this PGS predicts wages, income, and occupational prestige and\n' +

      'educational attainment can predict upward income and occupational mobility even\n' +
      'within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin\n' +
      'Longitudinal Study (WLS), I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment\n' +
      'predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when\n' +
      'respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about\n' +

      'covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status,\n' +
      'is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is\n' +
      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +
      'our understanding of longitudinal inequality and shed light on the sources of\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +
      'propose a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +
      'Linear amplification yields S-functions as only analytic solutions.\n' +

      'quantitative information on long-term demand. The theory is self-consistent. It\n' +
      'reproduces all peaceful data from 1800 to date without adjustable parameter. It\n' +
      'has full forecasting power since the decisive parameters are constants of the\n' +

    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Digitalization of Higher Education: Experience of Implementation',
    summary: 'In the article is considered the analysis of digitalization impact on the education system, the scientific view of its impact on the education system is analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of the impact of digitalization are revealed, the perspectives and trends of digitalization in the education system of the Republic of Uzbekistan are described. The beginning of the twenty-first century is due to the active implementation of digitalization processes in the modern economy. The digital economy touches every aspect of life: healthcare, education, online banking, and government. Modern Uzbekistan is a part of the world economic community, in this regard, the processes taking place in the international market require active entry into the global information community. For this purpose, Uzbekistan has paid special attention to the development of ICT since the early 1990s. Authors analyze the concepts and the ways of development of the digital transformation in education, examine the main trends in the e-learning market in Uzbekistan, and also identify the perspectives of its development and the features of new digital skills and competencies of its participants. In the article examined the results of active implementation of digital technologies in the educational system during recent years in Uzbekistan, it is concluded that the digitalization promotes the improvement of accessibility and quality of higher education. Creating digital platforms, developing online courses and distance learning allow for more effective interaction between students and teachers, opening up new opportunities for the formation of highly competitive workforce. Implementation of digital innovations in the field of education plays a crucial role in training of young specialists capable of successfully integration into the global economy and an information society.',

Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'Advancing Digital Privacy Education: A Global Curriculum Initiative',
    summary: 'As digital privacy becomes a critical concern across industries, structured education in this field is urgently needed. To address this gap, ACM, IEEE, and IFIP have launched a collaborative initiative to develop a Privacy Curricular Guideline for graduate programs. This framework defines core knowledge areas and aligns academic training with real-world needs. A Joint Taks Force of global experts identified eight foundational pillars for digital privacy education: (1) Privacy Body of Knowledge, (2) Privacy Foundations, (3) General Computer Science Concepts for Privacy, (4) Privacy-Preserving Computer Science/Software Engineering, (5) Information Systems/Technology, (6) Privacy Development Lifecycle, (7) Applied Domains, and (8) Privacy-related Industry Perspective. These are now being refined by dedicated Working Groups. This work is highly relevant to IFIP TC11 WG11.8, as privacy complements security but requires distinct focus areas addressing issues of user autonomy, data governance, and ethical considerations. Currently, privacy topics are often scattered across computer security and information security courses, leaving graduates unprepared for specialized privacy technologist roles. The initiative aims to bridge the education-practice gap and equip students with skills for emerging privacy challenges.',

    title: 'Optimization of Corporate Governance from the Perspectives of Law and Economics and Blockchain',
    summary: 'Blockchain’s spontaneous consensus mechanism, characterized by technologies of decentralization, immutability, high transparency, and codification, helps address agency costs and the formalization of shareholder meetings in traditional corporate governance. With the advancement of blockchain technology, the integration of legal rules and code rules in corporate governance has become the new norm. As per the transaction cost theory of law and economics and the Coase Theorem, blockchain has promoted changes in governance rules by markedly reducing agency costs within companies. Corporate governance will exhibit partial and gradual adjustments when blockchain technology substantially diminishes these costs but falls short of achieving the optimal state of zero transaction costs. These changes not only enhance the transparency and efficiency of corporate governance but also effectively curb the misconduct of controlling shareholders and protect the rights of minority shareholders.',

    summary: 'Although Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) presents vast opportunities and potential within the educational domain, the optimal integration of educational theory with GAI to enhance academic performance and problem-solving skills remains an area that requires further exploration. Therefore, this study aims to develop an integrating GAI with self-explanations scaffolding platform to enhance students’ learning performance and problem-solving skills through completing scaffolding tasks. Furthermore, this study evaluates students’ perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the system based on the Technology Acceptance Model. The findings indicate that students in the experimental group demonstrated a significant improvement in learning performance and problem-solving skills after utilizing the platform proposed by this study. Additionally, the experimental group exhibited positive technology acceptance toward the platform. Finally, results from the semi-structured interviews suggest that learning programming through the self-explanations scaffolding platform can mitigate learning setbacks, provide cognitive guidance, strengthen conceptual connections, facilitate knowledge construction, and enhance application skills.',
