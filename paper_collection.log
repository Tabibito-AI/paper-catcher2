    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Analyzing the User Experience of Virtual Pedagogy in Architecture Education',
    summary: 'This study aims to analyze the user experience of virtual pedagogy in architecture education. It seeks to gather valuable feedback and perceptions from teachers and students regarding the effectiveness, challenges, and benefits of virtual pedagogy. The study employs a quantitative research design using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the user experience, challenges, advantages, and overall satisfaction with virtual pedagogy in architecture education. The findings reveal the widespread use of tools and applications, such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and Zoom etc., for delivering both studio-based and non-studio-based courses in the virtual learning environment. The study highlights several challenges associated with virtual pedagogy, particularly for studio-based subjects, including the lack of in-person experience crucial for effective learning, difficulties in providing hands-on training, discouragement of active learning, and inadequate access to specialized tools and software. Additionally, the findings indicate that while virtual pedagogy offers flexibility and accessibility, it faces challenges in replicating the spontaneous interactions and hands-on nature of traditional in-person design studios.',

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Parent-based sexual education interventions have a positive impact on adolescent sexual and reproductive health. However, despite these positive outcomes, there is a lack of comprehensive research to understand the effectiveness of these programs across different communities and demographics.\n' +
      'METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of databases from January 2013 to April 2023 and identified 51 published studies conducted globally on the effects of parent-based sexual education. We conducted meta-analyses to understand the pooled effect of interventions on parent-adolescent communication outcomes and adolescent sexual and reproductive behaviors.\n' +
      "RESULTS: This review includes 51 studies. Most of the included studies (n = 36, 68.6%) were conducted in high-income countries; 17 (33.3%) involved only mothers, and 37 (72.5%) stated they were based on theoretical frameworks. The systematic review showed that interventions on sexual communication had mixed effects on parent and adolescent-related outcomes. The meta-analysis, however, showed positive effects on parent-reported sexual health communication frequency, adolescent-reported sexual health communication frequency, parental attitude, and parental self-efficacy, Cohen's d = 0.32, 0.26, 0.38, and 0.41, respectively.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Parent-based sexual health education interventions positively impact various aspects of parent-adolescent sexual health communication and behavior, suggesting the effectiveness of the intervention in different social, cultural, and economic contexts.

    title: 'The prevalence of pharmacogenetic testing in the United States.',
    abstract: 'It is unknown how many people in the US have had pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing and whether people want to be tested. We conducted a nationally representative survey of the general US adult population to determine the prevalence of adults that have had PGx testing using a validated confidential online survey, the Non-Medical Use of Prescription Drugs Program. A weighted logistic regression was used to test health characteristics associated with PGx testing and determine those who desire to be tested. The analysis included 29 146 individuals who completed the survey, which represents approximately 260 000 000 adults in the US. The prevalence of US adults who have been PGx tested is 6.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.2-7.0]. Only 32.2% (95% CI: 31.5-32.9), an estimated 79 million individuals, desired PGx testing. Adults who had or want PGx testing were more likely to be female, have higher education, be students, current or former members of the military, use medications, and have a mental health disorder. The prevalence of adults who have been PGx tested remains low in the US. There are knowledge gaps about the benefits of PGx testing that must be bridged to increase implementation.',

    title: 'The Development and Implementation of a Simulated Patient Resource for Teaching and Assessment in Optometry Low Vision Rehabilitation.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: To report on the development, evaluation, and acceptability of a simulated patient resource designed for teaching and assessment in low vision rehabilitation. The findings aim to inform possible future integration of this method into optometric education.\n' +
      'METHODS: In response to COVID-19 restrictions, a simulated patient resource was developed to allow students undertaking the practical elements of postgraduate modules in low vision practice at Cardiff University to complete their training. Using a mixed methods case study approach, the evaluation examined perspectives from students, assessors, and simulated patients, to establish if there was a consensus of opinion on its use. The study did not seek to demonstrate educational impact or validate SiP against existing methods.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Five assessors, five simulated patients and seven students completed evaluations. Both assessors and students broadly accepted the method for both teaching and assessment, with mean scores across all groups ranging from 7.3 to 9.6 on a 1-10 scale (where 1 indicated very poor acceptance and 10 excellent acceptance). The discussion and establishing magnification elements of the encounter were the least well accepted. Simulated patients found the level of preparation for the role adequate. There were no significant differences between Likert scores between assessors and students in both the teaching and assessment sessions. Thematic analysis of free text comments showed in the main positive responses, with all groups highlighting the benefits of detailed scenarios and pre-session training. The method was acceptable to the professional governing and accrediting body, the College of Optometrists.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Implementing a guideline-compliant simulated patient resource for high-stakes assessment requires significant time and resources. Our single cohort analysis indicates broad acceptance amongst assessors and students. Further research is needed to evaluate its educational impact across a wider range of scenarios and competencies while also further assessing its validity. Though simulated patients offer a viable alternative for teaching and assessing low vision practice, real patient encounters remain preferable.',

    title: 'Oncology Treatment in India: A Narrative Exploration of Patient Engagement and Care Strategies.',
    abstract: "The growing burden of cancer poses a significant public health challenge, with late-stage diagnoses leading to severe health complications. As a life-altering disease, cancer not only impacts individuals but also affects their families, communities, and the nation as a whole. Effective patient engagement is crucial for improving health outcomes, and while India has made considerable progress in this area, several challenges persist. This narrative review aims to explore patient engagement and care strategies implemented by oncology healthcare providers across India. In order to do this, a comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google, using keywords such as patient engagement, patient engagement in oncology, patient engagement by cancer care hospitals, community engagement, community outreach, and patient-centered care by oncology service providers. Websites of key oncology service providers were also explored to identify the patient engagement and care strategies implemented by these service providers. The review specifically examines research from India to ensure relevance to the country's healthcare landscape. These strategies include patient education and empowerment, technology-driven innovations, community-based initiatives, patient-centered communication, health gamification and incentive programs, and caregiver and family involvement. Findings indicate that enhancing community participation, expanding financial support programs, integrating artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital health solutions, and increasing telemedicine accessibility can significantly improve patient involvement and health outcomes. The review found numerous barriers that hinder widespread adoption, including disparities in healthcare access, low health literacy, lack of awareness and motivation, technological challenges, increasing out-of-pocket expenses, an insufficient medical workforce, and limited cancer research. Systematically addressing these challenges is essential for establishing an inclusive, accessible, and patient-centered oncology care system in India.",

    title: 'Interstitial Nephritis Induced by Repeated Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Use for Persistent Fever: A Case Report.',
    abstract: 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are extensively utilized for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory efficacy, yet they pose a significant risk for renal adverse events, notably drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis (DI-AIN). Prompt recognition and appropriate management are paramount to prevent irreversible kidney damage. We present the case of a 46-year-old male with NSAID-induced DI-AIN, emphasizing the diagnostic utility of a specific urinary biomarker profile and the rationale for empirical steroid therapy initiated before histopathological confirmation. Our patient developed acute kidney injury (AKI) following daily ibuprofen administration for persistent fever. Despite ibuprofen discontinuation on day eight, renal function failed to improve, necessitating hospital admission on day 14. On day 15, his serum creatinine (Cr) level was 1.86 mg/dL. Urinalysis revealed mild proteinuria [urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR): 0.24 g/gCr] but strikingly elevated urinary tubular injury markers: N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG): 20.9 U/L (on day one), β2-microglobulin (β2MG): 6028 μg/L, and L-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP): 27.75 ng/mL. Based on a strong clinical suspicion of DI-AIN, a kidney biopsy was performed on day 15, and oral prednisolone (PSL, 0.8 mg/kg/day) was commenced the same evening before biopsy results were available. Serum creatinine improved to 1.56 mg/dL by discharge on day 23. Post-discharge, kidney biopsy results confirmed AIN. PSL was gradually tapered and discontinued after approximately 10 months, with sustained renal function recovery (serum creatinine: ~1.1 mg/dL). This report underscores the importance of suspecting DI-AIN in patients with AKI and a history of NSAID exposure. The pronounced elevation of urinary tubular markers, despite only mild proteinuria, was pivotal in raising clinical suspicion. The negative autoimmune serology further strengthened the diagnosis of a drug-induced etiology. Empirical steroid therapy, initiated due to compelling clinical evidence before histopathological confirmation, appeared to be an effective intervention. While this single case cannot establish a therapeutic standard, it illustrates a clinical scenario where early, empirically-guided treatment may be justified. Kidney biopsy remains indispensable for definitive diagnosis. The report also highlights the pressing need for enhanced patient education on appropriate NSAID utilization. Repeated use of common NSAIDs can precipitate DI-AIN. A diagnostic profile of elevated urinary tubular markers with only mild proteinuria can be a key indicator for suspecting this condition. Empirical steroid therapy, guided by strong clinical suspicion, can be an effective early intervention, with subsequent kidney biopsy providing definitive diagnostic validation. Enhanced patient education on appropriate NSAID use is essential.',

    title: 'Enhancing Childhood-Educator Knowledge and Confidence: Virtual "Coffee Chat" Interventions with Medical Professionals.',
    abstract: `Context Early childhood educators (ECEs) are central to the development and care of children, but they often lack adequate access to resources and expert guidance for managing common childhood health issues. These challenges can lead to significant stress for both educators and parents. To address this gap, a pilot intervention involving virtual "coffee chat" sessions was implemented. These sessions aimed to provide ECEs with evidence-based knowledge and practical strategies to handle frequent childhood health concerns. Objective The primary objective of this study was to enhance the knowledge and confidence of ECEs in addressing common health and behavioral issues among children in the New River Valley, USA. The sessions, facilitated by pediatricians and medical students, covered a range of topics identified as high-priority by educators. The goal was to create a sustainable educational model for improving child health management in childcare settings. Methods This study used a self-designed pre- and post-survey format to measure the effectiveness of eight virtual "coffee chat" sessions conducted over two years. The initial sessions focused on educators in the New River Valley, USA, and the final session expanded across Virginia, USA. Topics included common illnesses (e.g., cough, diarrhea), trauma management, obesity, and behavioral issues such as self-regulation and temper tantrums. Each session consisted of a brief evidence-based presentation followed by interactive discussions. Participants were recruited through local and statewide child care organizations, and surveys were used to assess changes in their confidence and knowledge levels. Descriptive statistics and a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test were applied to analyze the data, while qualitative feedback from open-ended responses was categorized thematically. Results Across the eight sessions, 30 registrations were recorded, with 19 participants, some of whom attended multiple sessions. Pre- and post-survey results demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge and confidence, with an overall p-value of <0.001. Six out of eight topics showed increased post-survey scores, with the session on self-regulation and temper tantrums, which had the largest cohort (N=10), yielding a significant improvement (p=0.0041), highlighting its broad impact and relevance. Feedback from participants highlighted the value of practical, evidence-based strategies and the opportunity to engage directly with healthcare professionals. However, variability was observed in some topics, such as diarrhea, where post-survey scores declined slightly, pointing to potential areas for improvement. Conclusion Virtual "coffee chat" sessions proved to be an effective, scalable method for improving the health management skills of ECEs. The intervention's interactive and accessible format was particularly appreciated by participants and shows promise as a model for ongoing professional development. However, given the study's design and sample size, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary. Future efforts should focus on refining content, expanding participation, and exploring long-term impacts on both educator practices and child outcomes.`,

    title: 'Unrolling the Mat: A Mixed-Methods Study of Yoga Awareness, Perceptions, and Barriers to Daily Practice Among MBBS Students.',
    abstract: "Introduction Yoga, rooted in Indian tradition, is recognized for its holistic health benefits. With a growing global emphasis on preventive health, yoga has gained attention for its capacity to mitigate stress, improve concentration and enhance general well-being. Burdened with academic pressures, irregular routines and sedentary lifestyles, medical students represent a group that could significantly benefit from incorporating yoga into their daily lives. This study aims to bridge this gap by evaluating MBBS students' awareness, perceptions, readiness to adopt yoga and the practical challenges they face, along with their views on integrating structured yoga sessions into their curriculum. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at AIIMS, Nagpur, among MBBS students, with a total of 155 students (100%) from the 2019 to 2023 batches. A structured, pre-validated questionnaire (Cronbach's α=0.973) was administered electronically using a Google Form link shared via student WhatsApp groups. The survey comprised five sections: awareness about yoga, perceptions about its preventive role in lifestyle disorders, readiness to integrate it into daily life, barriers to practice and preferences regarding formal integration of yoga practice in the MBBS curriculum. Responses were recorded on 5-point Likert scales. Data analysis was performed using Python (Jupyter) for cleaning, statistics and reliability testing, and Jamovi (v2.3.28) for non-parametric tests due to non-normal distribution. Results The findings revealed a high awareness among participants, with an average awareness score (87.6%), high agreement on yoga's role in stress reduction (4.45%) and overall health (4.63%). Perception of yoga as preventive and therapeutic for lifestyle disorders was strong (mean=84.0%). Batch-wise differences were noted in yoga awareness scores (p<0.001), and interns were more likely to endorse yoga as a complementary therapy (p=0.037). The readiness score was 68.2%, with only a 3.41/5 average agreement on willingness to integrate yoga daily. A significant gender-based difference was observed for perceived physical preparedness (p=0.035) and preference for educational content in yoga, with males scoring higher. Major barriers included time constraints (112, 72.2%), inconsistency (93, 60%) and lack of motivation to wake up early (84, 54.54%). Overall, 140 (90.3%) agreed that yoga practice should be part of the MBBS curriculum. Most preferred physical sessions (116, 74.84%), held three days a week (63, 40.65%), for 20-30 mins (93, 61.59%), with a focus on postures, breathing, meditation and stress relief. Some students preferred sessions to be optional and scheduled flexibly around academic hours. Conclusion This study highlights a significant gap between high levels of awareness and relatively low readiness to incorporate yoga into daily life among MBBS students. Despite recognizing its benefits, students face notable practical challenges, especially time management and consistency. However, the overwhelming support for integrating structured yoga sessions into the medical curriculum presents an actionable opportunity. Addressing identified barriers through flexible scheduling, optional participation and an emphasis on stress management may enhance adoption. These findings underscore the potential of yoga not just as a wellness tool but as an integral component of medical education aimed at fostering personal resilience and long-term professional well-being.",

      'METHODS: Using the WIC infant and toddler feeding practices study-2 (unweighted  = 3051; weighted  = 413,211), classification and regression tree identified the sequence of binary splits that best differentiated the sample on Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020; range 0-100) and HEI-2020 subscales (adequacy and moderation), and body mass index (BMI in kg/m) -score at 2-5 y. Predictors, including maternal BMI, child birthweight, sociodemographics, and length of time spent on safety net programs, were considered.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Higher HEI-2020 scores were primarily predicted by race and ethnicity (e.g., Hispanic, Spanish, or non-Hispanic White), and longer WIC and shorter Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program duration. In examining HEI-2020 subscales, higher HEI adequacy was primarily predicted by higher education, older maternal age, longer WIC duration, and race and ethnicity. Higher HEI moderation was primarily predicted by race and ethnicity and longer WIC duration. Higher BMI -score was primarily predicted by higher birth weight.\n' +
