    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    title: 'Teacher agency and student diversity in reading education: What do Australian teachers think?',
    summary: 'State-level governments across Australia have made a commitment via public announcements to ensuring that all schools are teaching reading using ‘consistent’, ‘compulsory’, ‘common practice’. Through a mixed-methods questionnaire with 51 schoolteachers from four states across Australia, this paper examines practitioner experiences of teacher agency and student diversity in reading education. The results reveal that teachers’ confidence in teaching reading often varied depending on their students’ reading proficiencies. High levels of confidence were often attributed to prior experience, professional knowledge, professional learning, access to resources, and/or relationships, while lack of confidence was often attributed to a lack of one or more of these factors. The study also found that while lack of agency did not necessarily equate to dissatisfaction with how teachers were expected to teach reading, primary school teachers had far less agency than cross-sector and secondary school teachers and were the most dissatisfied with their practice. The study highlights, at a time of workforce shortages, that teachers’ sense of agency, respectful relationships and professional learning remain problematic within reading education, especially in the primary sector and wherever student and teacher diversity is ignored.',

    title: 'Parental Attitude Towards Sex Education: A Study of Demographic and Socio-Cultural Determinants in Rural Nigeria',
    summary: 'Introduction In contemporary rural Nigeria, the level of engagement of teenagers (secondary school students) in risky sexual behaviours is growing, and it has been linked to the rising rate of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STIs). While there are many studies on factors influencing the attitude of parents/guardians on the inclusion of sex education in secondary school curriculum, a research gap exists concerning the specific strengths of socio-cultural factors influencing parental attitude towards the teaching of sex education in secondary schools in rural Nigeria. Therefore, this study seeks to address this gap by investigating socio-cultural factors influencing parents/guardians’ attitude towards the adoption of sex education in secondary schools in rural Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional survey design was adopted. Multi-stage sampling technique was adopted to select ( n  = 4620). The data were collected in the year 2023 using a questionnaire schedule. Data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive analysis (frequency distribution tables and percentage) was done to describe and summarize the data. Also, inferential analysis (regressions) was done to test the formulated hypotheses. Results The results revealed that ethnicity (3.21 [2.54–6.57]; p  = 0.001), educational level (7.78 [7.29–13.11]; p  = 0.014), occupation (− 2.41 [(− 1.32)–(− 5.19)]; p  = 0.001), religiosity (5.34 [4.13–6.16]; p  = 0.001) and cultural belief (5.94 [5.18–8.47]; p  = 0.001) have significant effect on the parents/guardians attitudes towards the adoption of sex education in secondary schools in rural Nigeria. Conclusion and Recommendations. The factors influencing parental attitude towards the inclusion of sex education in secondary school curriculum include religiosity, cultural belief, level of education, ethnicity and occupation. Therefore, awareness programs about the importance of sex education for teens should be intensified at all levels. Policy Implications The findings of this study inform policy especially enlightenment programs for parents/guardians on the need and importance of sex education in reducing risky sexual behaviours among secondary school students in rural Nigeria. Most parents/guardians have negative attitudes towards it because of a lack of awareness. ',

    title: 'Virtual reality for education on infection prevention and control: the impact on medical students’ knowledge, attitudes and practices',
    summary: 'Background This study aims to analyse the impact of a newly developed infection prevention and control (IPC) Virtual Reality (VR)-module on medical students’ IPC knowledge, attitudes and practices. Additionally, the impact of the module on students’ and healthcare professionals’ (HCPs) confidence regarding IPC decision-making and their insight into consequences of IPC decisions were analysed. Methods The IPC VR-module was developed using a cyclical design process consisting of a prototype, first and final version. Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding IPC were compared between two groups of medical students. The VR-module was added to the IPC program for the VR group. After completion of the program, students of both groups were asked to complete an online questionnaire. Scores were summated for each subscale of the KAP, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare scores between groups. Student and HCP responses to VR-specific questions were dichotomized and a chi-square test was used to compare responses to different versions of the module. Results Students who completed the VR-module ( n  = 34) scored higher on IPC knowledge questions (score 8 / 10), than those who followed the regular program ( n  = 58; score 7/10; p  = 0.003). For the final version, the added value of the VR-module in the program was recognized by 95% of students and 90% of HCPs. Students and HCPs who completed the final version of the VR-module agreed more often with learning objectives of the VR-module than those who completed the first version. 100% vs. 80% for the statement on insight into consequences of choices ( p  < 0.001) and 89% vs. 73% for the statement on confidence taking IPC decisions ( p  < 0.001). Conclusions The innovative IPC VR-module positively impacted students IPC knowledge and was highly appreciated by students and HCPs. VR-specific learning objectives were achieved, especially for the final version of the VR-module, demonstrating the importance of a cyclical design process.',

    title: 'Fostering students’ motivation and self-efficacy in science, technology, engineering, and design through design thinking and making in project-based learning: a gender-perspective study in primary education',
    summary: 'This study examines the impact of integrating Design Thinking and Maker Education into project-based learning (PBL) activities on primary school students’ self-efficacy and motivation in Science, Technology, and Design. Drawing on Bandura’s social cognitive theory, the study addresses the gap in empirical research at the primary education level, particularly concerning gender disparities in STEM engagement. Over a three-year period, 12 public schools in Barcelona ( n  = 318 students in grades 4–6) participated in a five-session workshop where students created technological prototypes using tools like Scratch and Makey Makey. Pre- and post-intervention surveys measured changes in students’ self-efficacy, motivation, and prior behavior. Results revealed significant improvements in students’ self-efficacy, particularly among girls, with moderate to large effect sizes in key items related to confidence and active information-seeking. While most responses indicated high satisfaction, some challenges were noted in early phases of the design process. These findings suggest that early exposure to PBL approaches incorporating Design Thinking and Making can help foster positive attitudes toward STEM and reduce early gender disparities. The study highlights the value of inclusive, hands-on pedagogies and calls for extended interventions and further longitudinal research to assess long-term impact.',

    title: 'Enhancing palliative care through university-community partnerships: a systematic review of models, impacts, and challenges',
    summary: 'Background University-community partnerships (UCPs) represent a transformative model for integrating student experiential learning with community-based palliative care. These partnerships enhance empathy, interdisciplinary collaboration, and service delivery, while addressing gaps in end-of-life care. Aim This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of UCPs in palliative care, focusing on their impact on student learning, community outcomes, and innovative practices. Methods Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for studies published between January 2014 and March 2024. This search yielded 206 unique citations. Nine studies were included after the full-text screening. Grey literature sources (e.g., reports and web-based articles) were screened but excluded due to insufficient methodological rigor, and thematic synthesis was conducted using NVivo, with two independent reviewers performing data extraction. The Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBIS (qualitative) and RoB 2 (quantitative) tools. Results Of the 206 records screened, nine studies (eight qualitative and one quantitative) met the inclusion criteria. The identified UCP models include transactional, transformational, and community-based participatory research (CBPR), with CBPR noted for contextual adaptability. UCPs contributed to improving student empathy, interprofessional learning, and community empowerment. Barriers include limited resources, cultural mismatches, and inconsistent stakeholder alignments. Innovations, such as telehealth and virtual learning, were also observed. Conclusion UCPs have strong potential to enhance palliative care education and delivery. Scaling these models requires sustainable funding, culturally responsive approaches, and policy integration. Future research must emphasize longitudinal designs and standardized evaluation structures.',

    title: 'ChatGPT Adoption in Higher Education: A Study of Faculty Generation Cohort, Self-Efficacy, and Innovativeness',
    summary: 'Generative AI such as ChatGPT has become prevalent in teaching higher education courses. There is a need to examine the perceptions of faculty to understand their decision in using ChatGPT. To address this gap, this study examined the generation cohort differences in relation to generative AI using Generation Cohort Theory. Further, this study also examined self-efficacy and innovativeness as positive predictors of the use of ChatGPT, using the theoretical frameworks of Social Cognitive Theory and Diffusions of Innovation. This study recruited 150 faculty participants from higher institutions in Texas using a convenience sampling approach. Chi-square results indicated that Generation Y and Generation X faculty were more likely to use generative AI in comparison to other generation cohorts. Generation Y faculty were also the most likely to incorporate ChatGPT in their assignments than other cohorts. Regression results also showed that self-efficacy and innovativeness were positive predictors of the use of ChatGPT in the classroom. Implications are also offered for education stakeholders.',

    title: 'Developing the Spanish Physical Literacy Assessment for Children (SPLA-C): a delphi-based model for assessing physical literacy in schoolchildren aged 6–12 years',
    summary: 'There are different recognized assessments of physical literacy (PL), with the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy-2 (CAPL-2) being the most widely recognized worldwide. Owing to sociocultural differences, creating a country-specific PL assessment becomes necessary. The aims of this study are 1) to develop an assessment model of the Spanish Physical Literacy Assessment for Children (SPLA-C) for Spanish schoolchildren aged 6–12 years and 2) to identify the assessment weights for each of the SPLA-C components, specifying the optimal tools. A documentary analysis was carried out in which experts were consulted, and the Delphi method was used. Twenty-eight experts took part in the Delphi process, and 23 experts completed all the rounds of the survey. Experts’ opinions are used to develop the assessment model of the SPLA-C and to identify the assessment weights for each component. A general consensus was obtained by the committee of experts for the proposed tools (85.2%). Conclusion :The SPLA-C could be considered a suitable method for assessing PL in Spanish children and adolescents and could be adapted to their educational-curricular and cultural context, after future studies analyze its psychometric properties, including the feasibility, reliability, and validity of each of the proposed instruments. What is Known : • PL supports lifelong physical activity. • No culturally adapted PL assessment exists for Spanish children. What is New : • The SPLA-C is a culturally adapted model for Spanish schoolchildren. • It defines five PL components and provides consensus-based assessment tools.',

    title: 'Orchestration of corporate social responsibility in company law – reframing human security through education',
    summary: 'The objective of this paper is to argue the fundamental significance of education in addressing notable gaps in the constitutive, performance and evaluation criteria for corporate social responsibility (CSR) and endeavours to showcase the complementarity between education, human security, sustainable human development, and the pursuit of CSR as an ideal normative paradigm. An abstractive approach to studying CSR, which is common with some authors engages with corporate philanthropy, which has not been helpful outside traditional CSR paradigms without looking at key dynamics that can robustly underpin successful CSR. The paper explores the systemic nexus between sustainable development as an educational externality when embedded in CSR, climate change and action competence and how it dovetails into ‘education for sustainable development’. Methodologically, this paper doctrinally relies on the systematic analysis of written data sources to theoretically explore the central significance, and complementarity between human security, education, and human dignity and how they can orchestrate a holistic CSR paradigm. In 1994, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in formulating the human security doctrine recognised the syncretic correlation between human security, education, and sustainable human development as fundamental elements that should underpin CSR. This paper contends that these are necessary intrinsic components of human dignity as the central factor that justifies a multi-dimensional and proactive approach to CSR. Despite the criticisms against human security, this paper identifies it as an important concept that could instrumentally orchestrate a model of CSR that uniformly mainstreams sustainable human development and human dignity that leverages education which has routinely and traditionally been seen as a constitutive component of CSR. It reveals how a holistic path to CSR can reinvigorate the central pillars of human security and human dignity using education as a springboard and makes a compelling case for supporting explicit references to education in company law with appropriate human security informed constitutive, performance and evaluation criteria which are absent in existing legally orchestrated CSR.',

    title: 'Practices and challenges of implementing early childhood care and education in Bahir Dar city administration, Ethiopia',
    summary: 'Early childhood care and education (ECCE) is the basis for the enduring instillation of personal habits and societal ideals. Thus, the study aimed to investigate the practice and challenges of implementing ECCE in Bahir Dar city administration, Ethiopia. To this end, a qualitative research approach with a multiple case study design was used. Qualitative data were collected from 40 participants (ECCE teachers, caregivers, unit leaders, school principals, and Bahir Dar city administration education experts). Observation, interviewing, and focus group discussion were used as data collection instruments. As a result, ECCE was poorly implemented. By and large, the finding of this study identified many challenges that inhibit the successful implementation of ECCE, such as lack of teachers and caregivers’ training, poor physical environment, inadequate resources/facilities, inappropriate teacher–student ratio, and unrealistic demands of parents. These hindrances increase learning gaps that widen over time, contributing to higher dropout rates and reduced literacy levels. The study results would have important implications for the advancement of the ECCE program. Additionally, the findings might inform policymakers and educators on areas that require further development or intervention, ultimately contributing to improving of early childhood learning experiences.',

    title: 'Hemoglobin level, anemia, and obesity among pregnant women in Kigali, Rwanda: a hospital-based cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Globally, there is an increasing trend of obesity in pregnant women, and Sub-Saharan Africa is not an exception. Recently, hemoglobin and anemia have received more attention as predictors of maternal obesity. No such study exists in Rwanda. Thus, the current study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the factors associated with obesity, including hemoglobin and anemia, among pregnant women in Kigali, Rwanda.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two hospitals in Kigali, Rwanda, from June to August 2024. A questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data. Weight, height, and hemoglobin were measured using standard procedures. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 445 pregnant women were recruited. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age and parity were 30.0 (26.0‒35.0) years and 1 (0‒3), respectively. Of the 445 women, 143 (32.1%), 249 (56.0%), and 53 (11.9%) were of normal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively. One hundred and seven (24.0%) pregnant women had anemia. In multivariate multinomial regression, no significant association was found between age, parity, residency, education, maternal occupation, hemoglobin level, anemia, and overweight status. Being from rural areas (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16‒5.56) and being a housewife (AOR = 4.34, 95% 1.42‒13.26) were significantly associated with obesity. While an increase in hemoglobin level was associated with obesity (AOR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.02‒1.60), anemia was inversely negatively associated with obesity (AOR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.12‒0.93).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This study indicates that 12% of the pregnant women in Rwanda were obese. Hemoglobin and anemia are associated with maternal obesity in Rwanda. There is a need for more efforts in nutritional programs targeting pregnant women to combat maternal obesity in Rwanda. Future research is recommended to explore the impact of maternal obesity on maternal and perinatal health.',

These partnerships enhance empathy, interdisciplinary collaboration, and service delivery, while addressing gaps in end-of-life care.\n' +
      'AIM: This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of UCPs in palliative care, focusing on their impact on student learning, community outcomes, and innovative practices.\n' +
      'METHODS: Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for studies published between January 2014 and March 2024. This search yielded 206 unique citations. Nine studies were included after the full-text screening. Grey literature sources (e.g., reports and web-based articles) were screened but excluded due to insufficient methodological rigor, and thematic synthesis was conducted using NVivo, with two independent reviewers performing data extraction. The Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBIS (qualitative) and RoB 2 (quantitative) tools.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of the 206 records screened, nine studies (eight qualitative and one quantitative) met the inclusion criteria. The identified UCP models include transactional, transformational, and community-based participatory research (CBPR), with CBPR noted for contextual adaptability. UCPs contributed to improving student empathy, interprofessional learning, and community empowerment. Barriers include limited resources, cultural mismatches, and inconsistent stakeholder alignments. Innovations, such as telehealth and virtual learning, were also observed.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: UCPs have strong potential to enhance palliative care education and delivery. Scaling these models requires sustainable funding, culturally responsive approaches, and policy integration. Future research must emphasize longitudinal designs and standardized evaluation structures.',

    title: "Virtual reality for education on infection prevention and control: the impact on medical students' knowledge, attitudes and practices.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: This study aims to analyse the impact of a newly developed infection prevention and control (IPC) Virtual Reality (VR)-module on medical students' IPC knowledge, attitudes and practices. Additionally, the impact of the module on students' and healthcare professionals' (HCPs) confidence regarding IPC decision-making and their insight into consequences of IPC decisions were analysed.\n" +
      'METHODS: The IPC VR-module was developed using a cyclical design process consisting of a prototype, first and final version. Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding IPC were compared between two groups of medical students. The VR-module was added to the IPC program for the VR group. After completion of the program, students of both groups were asked to complete an online questionnaire. Scores were summated for each subscale of the KAP, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare scores between groups. Student and HCP responses to VR-specific questions were dichotomized and a chi-square test was used to compare responses to different versions of the module.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Students who completed the VR-module (n = 34) scored higher on IPC knowledge questions (score 8 / 10), than those who followed the regular program (n = 58; score 7/10; p = 0.003). For the final version, the added value of the VR-module in the program was recognized by 95% of students and 90% of HCPs. Students and HCPs who completed the final version of the VR-module agreed more often with learning objectives of the VR-module than those who completed the first version. 100% vs. 80% for the statement on insight into consequences of choices (p < 0.001) and 89% vs. 73% for the statement on confidence taking IPC decisions (p < 0.001).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The innovative IPC VR-module positively impacted students IPC knowledge and was highly appreciated by students and HCPs. VR-specific learning objectives were achieved, especially for the final version of the VR-module, demonstrating the importance of a cyclical design process.',

    title: 'Effects of a single session of in-person and remote strength training on low back pain and disability outcomes in pregnant women: a randomized and controlled crossover clinical trial.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of a single session of in-person and remote strength training on the outcomes of low back pain, functional disability, and enjoyment in pregnant women.\n' +
      'METHODS: The methodology used was an approved controlled and randomized clinical trial by the Research Ethics Committee and registered in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry. The study involved seventeen pregnant women undergoing one in-person strength training session (IS), one remote strength training session (RS), and one control session (CS) in a randomly determined order. The team conducted assessments using questionnaires for low back pain, functional disability, and enjoyment. We compared the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) method with a Bonferroni complementary test (α = 0.05) and the Mann-Whitney U test.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Reduced values of low back pain were found after the session for the SUM item in the in-person (Δ-2.06), remote (Δ-1.59), and control (Δ-2.17) sessions, as well as for the INTENSITY item in the in-person (Δ-0.23), remote (Δ-0.12), and control (Δ-0.3) sessions. Reductions in disability values 24 h after the session were observed for the remote (Δ-0.76) and control (Δ-1.59) sessions. Additionally, positive enjoyment values were noted after in-person (117) and remote (119) sessions.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: It is concluded that a strength training session can potentially improve or maintain the acute low back pain and disability scale without causing an increase in low back pain symptoms. Furthermore, it can promote a high level of enjoyment, regardless of whether it is conducted in person or remotely. Health education strategies, such as those proposed by the control session in this study, are also beneficial.',

    title: 'Characterizing the Venezuelan situation between 2014-2020 in a population-based study using seven key indicators.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Venezuela has faced a crisis over the past decade. This study aims to characterize the crisis and identify the population's most vulnerable subgroups.\n" +
      'METHODS: Follow-up data (2018-2020) from 1,257 subjects (35% of the total) who participated in the nationally representative sample of the Venezuelan Study of Cardiometabolic Health (EVESCAM, 2014-2017) were analyzed. The distribution of seven crisis indicators- food insecurity, stressful life events, family separation, disruption in access to utilities (water, electricity, gas, or sanitation), lack of access to medications, lack of access to transportation, and disruption of childhood education- were analyzed across five subgroups (age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status [SES], and education). Logistic regression adjusted by other socio-demographic variables was used to analyze associations among variables.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Of the total sample, 71.8% were female, 67.0% ≥ 50 years old, 52% low SES, and 80.2% Mixed ethnicity. Overall, 77.3% reported disruption in access to at least one utility and 31.7% to two or more utilities. The former was higher in females (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.98) and those with lower education (OR 2.03, 1.27-3.23). Lack of electricity (70.2%) was similar across subgroups. Lack of transportation (76.2%) affected females (OR 1.36, 1.10-1.67) and those of Mixed ethnicity more strongly. Disruption of children's education was reported more in homes with the youngest, Amerindian, low SES, and less educated participants. Family separation (49.2%) affected older and female participants more strongly. Food insecurity (60.2%) was more frequent in the low SES group compared with the high SES group (OR 2.17, 1.45-3.25). Stressful life events (67.2%) and lack of medications (43.8%) did not differ across subgroups.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The Venezuelan humanitarian crisis has heightened vulnerability to crisis indicators among women, elders, those with low SES, and less educated subgroups of the population. These findings should prompt cost-effective programs targeted at those most vulnerable.',

    title: 'Complex psychological responses to climate change: a longitudinal study exploring the interplay between climate change awareness and climate change anxiety among Chinese adolescents.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Adolescents are increasingly recognized as important stakeholders in responding to the challenges of climate change, with their psychological responses shaping both mental health outcomes and behavioral choices. However, the intricate relationship between climate change awareness and climate change anxiety among adolescents, as significant manifestations of psychological reactions to climate change, has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Grounded in the Stress and Coping Theory, this study aimed to empirically investigate the bidirectional relationship between climate change awareness and climate change anxiety among Chinese adolescents.\n' +
      'METHODS: Data were collected through a three-wave longitudinal survey (2022-2024) from 426 Chinese adolescents. We employed repeated measures ANOVA to examine developmental patterns and gender differences in climate change awareness and climate change anxiety, and constructed cross-lagged panel models, along with the calculation of feedback effects, to investigate their reciprocal relationships across time points.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Results revealed significant increases in both climate change awareness and climate change anxiety over time, with females consistently exhibiting higher levels. Cross-lagged analyses demonstrated that climate change awareness significantly predicted an increase in climate change anxiety, and climate change anxiety, in turn, significantly enhanced climate change awareness. Furthermore, the feedback effect between climate change awareness and climate change anxiety was significant at both T1-T2 and T2-T3 intervals.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a bidirectional relationship between climate change awareness and anxiety among adolescents, providing a theoretical framework and empirical evidence for understanding adolescents' complex psychological responses to climate change. It also presents valuable suggestions for implementing targeted mental health interventions, and climate change education.",

    title: 'Predicting obesity at adolescence from an early age in a Dutch observational cohort study: the development and internal validation of a multivariable prediction model.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: - Identifying children with a high risk of developing future obesity could enable timely targeted prevention strategies. The study's objective was to develop prediction models that could detect if young children at very early age, from birth to age six, have an increased risk of being obese in early adolescence.\n" +
      'METHODS: - We analyzed a subset of data (N = 4,309) from the Generation R study, a population-based prospective cohort study of pregnant women and their children from fetal life to young adulthood in the Netherlands. Parental, household, and birth/child characteristics were considered as predictors. We developed separate models for children at age zero (three months), two, four, and six years that predict obesity at age 10 to 14 years. Per age we fitted an optimal prediction model (full model) and a more practical model with less predictors (restricted model). For the development of the prediction models we used regularized regression models with a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty to avoid overfitting.\n' +
      'RESULTS: - Parental body mass index (BMI), parental education level, latest child BMI measurements, ethnicity of the child, breakfast consumption, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of the child were included as predictors in all models when considered as candidate predictor. The models for all age groups performed well (lowest area under the curve (AUC) 0.872 for the age 0 restricted model), with the highest performance for the 6-year model (AUC 0.954 and 0.949, full and restricted model). Sensitivity and specificity of models varied between ages with ranges 0.80-0.90 (full model); 0.79-0.89 (restricted model) and 0.80-0.88 (full model); 0.79-0.87 (restricted model).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: - These obesity prediction models seem promising and could be used as valuable tools for early detection of children at increased risk of being obese at adolescence, even at an early age.',

    title: 'Trends and pattern of contraceptive use among women attending a family planning clinic at a tertiary health facility in Ibadan, Nigeria.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Despite consistent reporting of high fertility levels in Nigeria, contraceptive prevalence rates remain low. Information on the type of contraceptive uptake among women who visit family planning (FP) clinics is still sketchy in Ibadan. Therefore, we assessed the trend and pattern of contraceptive use among women attending a FP clinic at a tertiary health facility in Ibadan.\n' +
      'METHODS: A mixed-method design was adopted for the study. Records of women (n = 1,619) who accessed FP services at the University College Hospital [UCH] from 2018 to 2022 were reviewed. The qualitative data included a key informant interview (KII) involving a senior officer of the FP Clinic and a focus group discussion (FGD) among high-fertility (≥ 4 living children) women. Data were analysed using a logistic regression model (α), and thematic analysis was used for the qualitative part of the study.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The mean age of women was 33.8 ± 6.34 years, 87.7% were in monogamous marriages, 82.3% were Yoruba, and 47.2% did not intend to bear more children. The uptake of long-term and short-term contraceptive methods showed a declining (slope = -3.5) and increasing (slope = + 4.4) trend, respectively. The likelihood of non-use of a long-term contraceptive method was lower among women with ≥ 3 surviving children who had tertiary education (uOR = 0.539, 95% C.I = 0.338-0.859, p = 0.009) and were Christians (uOR = 0.410, 95% C.I = 0.258-0.652, p < 0.001) compared to their counterparts with at most secondary education and were Muslims, respectively. High fertility women who are not using Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods (LACMs) identified fear, partner's influence, misconceptions, cost, parity, privacy, and inconvenience as reasons for the non-use of the methods.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Conceptive uptake at the UCH followed an increasing trend from 2018 to 2022. Sensitisation on the adoption of LACMs among high-fertility women might improve the use of such methods in the study area.',

    title: 'The effect of early childhood stature on later cognitive functions in Indonesian adolescents: comparation using the National growth reference and the WHO growth standard.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The prevalence of short stature in children under 5 using the National Growth Reference vs. the WHO Growth Standard is known to vary in many countries. Previous research has suggested possible associations between short stature early in childhood, frequently regarded as stunting, and later cognitive function.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the effect of early childhood stature, using the National Indonesian Growth Chart (NIGC) vs. the WHO Growth Standard (WHO), on cognitive function in adolescence.\n' +
      'METHODS: The study used two cohort data from the Indonesia Family Life Surveys (IFLS) that had both anthropometric data at the age of 2-5 years and at adolescence, as well as information on cognitive function at adolescence. At the age of 2-5 years, the height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) of the subjects were classified using both NIGC and WHO as follows: Normal NIGC & Normal WHO; Normal NIGC & Short WHO; and Short NIGC & Short WHO. In adolescence, cognitive function were assessed. An analysis was performed to assess the associations between variables.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Cohort-1 included 866 subjects with complete information, while Cohort-2 included 1,436 subjects. After adjustment, subjects aged 2 to 5 years classified as Short NIGC & Short WHO had a consistent significantly negative effect on their later adolescent cognitive function: coefficient regression (95%CI): -2.82 {(-5.58)-(-0.06), p = 0.046}for Cohort-1 and - 4.13 {(-7.22)-(-1.04), p = 0.009} for Cohort-2. On the other hand, those classified as Short for WHO but Normal for NIGC were not associated with later negative cognitive function: coefficient regression (95%CI): -1.88 {(-4.00)- 0.24, p = 0.082} for Cohort-1 and - 1.32 {(-3.50)-0.87, p = 0.237} for Cohort-2. Cognitive function of both cohorts was also significantly influenced by the subjects' education, parental education and resicence in urban and Java-Bali (p < 0.05).\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Childhood stature was associated with later negative cognitive function only when the children were classified as short using NIGC. Classified as short stature using WHO, but not short using NIGC, was not associated with later negative cognitive function.\n' +

    title: "Household income and children's mental health outcomes: the mediating role of maternal wellbeing and parent-child relationship quality.",
    abstract: "Uncertainty remains about the mechanism(s) through which household income influences mental health across the life course. The family stress model suggests the role of parental mental health and child-parent relationship quality may be significant, however few studies have explored this longitudinally. The present study aimed to decompose the pathways from low household income at age 3 to children's mental wellbeing at age 6, via maternal wellbeing (age 4) and parent-child relationship quality (age 5). We included four sweeps of the Growing Up in Scotland Study (n = 3639). Weights and multiple imputation were used. Low income was defined as the two bottom quintiles of equivalised household income. Potential mental health difficulties were determined using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Mediators were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and the Pianta Child-Parent Relationship Scale. A causal mediation analysis was conducted. Confounding factors adjusted for included ethnicity, family type, maternal age, education and employment. Children from low-income households at age 3 were more than twice as likely to have a potential mental health difficulty at age 6 compared to all other children (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.16 (95% CI 1.50 to 3.80). Reduced maternal wellbeing mediated 11.21% of the total effect. Adding perceived child-parent relationship quality to this model increased the proportion mediated to 30.89%. Increasing the incomes of young families will improve child mental health. Given the long-term risks associated with childhood mental health difficulties this should be a public health priority.",
