    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Analyzing the User Experience of Virtual Pedagogy in Architecture Education',
    summary: 'This study aims to analyze the user experience of virtual pedagogy in architecture education. It seeks to gather valuable feedback and perceptions from teachers and students regarding the effectiveness, challenges, and benefits of virtual pedagogy. The study employs a quantitative research design using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the user experience, challenges, advantages, and overall satisfaction with virtual pedagogy in architecture education. The findings reveal the widespread use of tools and applications, such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and Zoom etc., for delivering both studio-based and non-studio-based courses in the virtual learning environment. The study highlights several challenges associated with virtual pedagogy, particularly for studio-based subjects, including the lack of in-person experience crucial for effective learning, difficulties in providing hands-on training, discouragement of active learning, and inadequate access to specialized tools and software. Additionally, the findings indicate that while virtual pedagogy offers flexibility and accessibility, it faces challenges in replicating the spontaneous interactions and hands-on nature of traditional in-person design studios.',

    title: 'Does back pain catastrophizing influence 60-month surgical outcomes for patients with degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis? A Quality Outcomes Database study.',
    abstract: "OBJECTIVE: Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is a common cause of back and leg pain influenced by factors like instability, disc degeneration, facet arthropathy, and psychosocial phenotype. Patients' experience of high-severity pain is complex, with significant implications for surgical planning. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of back pain catastrophizing on long-term outcomes following lumbar spondylolisthesis surgery.\n" +
      'METHODS: This study uses the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) lumbar spondylolisthesis dataset and includes prospectively collected data from the 12 highest-enrolling clinical sites participating in the QOD lumbar module. The authors reviewed patients undergoing single-segment surgery for grade 1 degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Severe baseline numeric rating scale for back pain (NRS-BP) scores (≥ 8) were classified as "catastrophizing," and mild to moderate pain scores (< 8) were classified as "non-catastrophizing." Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared for catastrophizing versus non-catastrophizing patients at 60 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess the impact of catastrophizing on PROs, with multivariate analysis controlling for variables initially reaching a p value < 0.10.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of the 608 patients in this analysis, 260 (42.8%) experienced catastrophizing while 348 (57.2%) did not. Catastrophizing patients were significantly younger (59.9 ± 12.2 years vs 63.9 ± 11.7 years, p < 0.001), less often had ≥ 4 years of college education (31.2% vs 42.5%, p = 0.004), and more often used private insurance (58.8% vs 47.7%, p = 0.01). The catastrophizing cohort also had higher rates of depression (24.6% vs 17.0%, p = 0.02) and back pain predominance (45.4% vs 32.2%, p < 0.001). Surgical and perioperative characteristics did not significantly differ between cohorts. Although catastrophizing patients typically reported worse PRO scores at both baseline and 60 months, they demonstrated significantly greater improvement and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) achievement across almost all PROs at 60 months (p < 0.05). However, North American Spine Society (NASS) satisfaction scores at 60 months did not differ significantly between cohorts. Multivariate analysis found that catastrophizing significantly predicted 60-month NRS-BP change (β -1.45, 95% CI -1.81 to -1.09; p < 0.001) and MCID achievement (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.52-2.58; p < 0.001) but not mean NRS-BP score or other metrics, including NASS satisfaction.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Despite presenting with worse baseline symptoms, patients with pain catastrophizing experienced substantial and clinically meaningful improvement following surgery for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Patient satisfaction was comparable between cohorts, reflecting a nuanced balance between greater absolute improvement and persistence of residual symptoms. These findings underscore that catastrophizing should not be viewed as a barrier to surgical success, while pointing to the need for proactive expectation setting and shared decision-making.',

    title: 'Optimizing Cardiovascular Risk Management in Primary Care Using a Personalized eCoach Solution Enhanced by an Artificial Intelligence-Driven Clinical Prediction Model: Protocol from the Coronary Artery Disease Risk Estimation and Early Detection Consortium.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease poses a heavy burden on the population's health and health care costs. Identifying apparently healthy individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases using clinical prediction models raises awareness, facilitates shared decision-making, and supports tailored management of disease prevention. In the CARRIER project, a personalized cardiovascular risk management (CVRM) eCoach approach is cocreated, in which identified individuals receive education, guidance, and monitoring to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease through existing interventions. In this approach, an artificial intelligence-driven clinical prediction model calculates the 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which supports informed decision-making.\n" +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of our CVRM eCoach approach through a 10-year risk calculation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including risk factors contributing to this risk.\n' +
      'METHODS: This pretest-posttest interventional study provides the CVRM eCoach approach for 6 months to 100 apparently healthy individuals eligible for CVRM. The CVRM eCoach approach is a multicomponent eHealth solution, including a clinical prediction under intervention model that not only calculates the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease through conventional risk factors (smoking, blood pressure, and lipid profile) and individual characteristics (age, gender, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and diet) but also calculates how the risk changes after hypothetical lifestyle or medical interventions. The CVRM eCoach approach includes features that encourage behavior change. Most of these features include goal setting, decision cards to help decide on an intervention, intervention monitoring, remote communication, and education, all accessible from one dashboard. A practice nurse or physician consults the individuals after risk calculation with the clinical prediction model and uses behavior change features, such as the decision cards, to support shared decision-making. Data are primarily collected via the eCoach, after which the 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its components are analyzed using paired-sample analyses.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Recruitment began in March 2024 and will continue until 100 participants have been recruited, which is expected in 2025.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that our CVRM eCoach approach will be valuable in the primary prevention setting. During the crucial initial first months of habit formation, factors such as education, regular check-ups via the eCoach, and clear risk communication could support individuals in sustaining their medical or lifestyle interventions. We hypothesize that there will be a slight to moderate reduction in the 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which over time will lead to significant health improvements on a larger scale.\n' +

    title: 'Technology Integration in Syrian Medical Education From the Perspective of Students and Faculty: A Cross-Sectional Evaluation.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) has become increasingly vital in global medical education, offering significant advantages in knowledge acquisition, communication, motivation, and student engagement. In Syria, a country facing prolonged crises, there is an urgent need to evaluate the integration of technology within medical education to address institutional limitations and support student learning.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the awareness, perceived challenges, and needs regarding the integration of technology in medical education from the perspectives of students and faculty at Syrian medical colleges.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted during the 2023-2024 academic year across Syrian universities. Stratified random sampling was used to recruit 500 medical students and 200 faculty members. Two tailored, self-administered questionnaires were used, covering motivation, perceived benefits, challenges, and suggestions for technology integration. Validity was assessed through expert review and pilot testing (n=30), and internal consistency was confirmed (Cronbach α=0.6-0.7). Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t tests, ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis tests.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among medical students, 94% (470\\500) agreed that integrating technology into medical education is essential, with similar agreement from 93.5% (187\\200) of faculty. No significant differences were found in student responses based on specialization (P=.32) or university type (P=.11). Likewise, faculty perspectives did not significantly differ by academic qualification or years of experience (P>.05). There were several perceived benefits; for instance, 93.2% (n=466) of students reported that technology kept them up to date with new developments, 88% stated it enhanced research skills, and 86.8% found TEL more enjoyable than traditional learning methods. Most respondents (95% n=475) said TEL created a flexible, interactive environment. Among faculty, 77% (n=154) agreed TEL improves clinical skill development. Respondents noted there were some challenges; specifically, 57% (n=285) of students cited poor internet service, 33% (n=165) noted the financial burden, and 82.2% (n=411) called for behavioral guidelines. Among faculty, 85.5% (n=171) cited lack of institutional support and 90% (n=180) emphasized the need for training. Both groups supported the development of communication platforms, curriculum revisions, and faculty development programs.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong consensus among Syrian medical students and faculty on the value and necessity of integrating technology in medical education. Despite infrastructure and administrative challenges, both groups recognize TEL as a powerful tool for improving clinical competencies, student motivation, and academic engagement. Institutional commitment, curricular reform, and tailored training are essential to achieving sustainable, effective technology integration.',

    title: 'Effects of a Theory- and Evidence-Based, Motivational Interviewing-Oriented Artificial Intelligence Digital Assistant on Vaccine Attitudes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Attitude-targeted interventions are important approaches for promoting vaccination. Educational approaches alone cannot effectively cultivate positive vaccine attitudes. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots and motivational interviewing (MI) techniques show high promise in improving vaccine attitudes and facilitating readiness for vaccination.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a theory and evidence-based, MI-oriented AI digital assistant in improving COVID-19 vaccine attitudes among adults in Hong Kong.\n' +
      'METHODS: This 2 parallel-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted from October 2022 to June 2024. Hong Kong adults (N=177) who were vaccine-hesitant were randomly assigned into 2 study groups. The intervention group (n=91) interacted with the AI digital assistant over 5 weeks, including receiving a web-based education program comprising 5 educational modules and communicating with an AI-driven chatbot equipped with MI techniques. The control group (n=86) received WhatsApp (Meta) messages directing them to government websites for COVID-19 vaccine information and knowledge, with the same dosage as the intervention group. Primary outcomes included vaccine hesitancy. Secondary outcomes included vaccine readiness, confidence, trust in government, and health literacy. Outcomes were measured at baseline, postintervention, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Focus group interviews were conducted postintervention. Intervention effects were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation model. Interview data were content analyzed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Decreases in vaccine hesitancy were observed while no statistically significant time-by-group interaction effects were found. The intervention showed significant time-by-group interaction effects on vaccine readiness (P=.04), confidence (P=.02), and trust in government (P=.04). Significant between-group differences with medium effect sizes were identified for vaccine readiness (Cohen d=0.52) and trust in government (Cohen d=0.54) postintervention, respectively. Increases in vaccine-related health literacy were observed, and a significant time effect was found (P=.01). In total, three categories were summarized from interview data: (1) improved vaccine literacy, confidence, and trust in government; (2) hesitancy varied while readiness improved; and (3) facilitators, barriers, and recommendations of modifications on the intervention.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The intervention indicated promising yet significant effects on vaccine readiness while the effects on vaccine hesitancy require further confirmation. The qualitative findings; however, further consolidate the significant effects on participants' attitudes toward vaccines. The findings provide novel evidence to encourage the adoption and refinement of a MI-oriented AI digital assistant in vaccine promotion.",

    title: 'Embedding Social-Emotional Learning in Elementary School-Based Speech-Language Therapy: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Many students with communication disorders have unique social-emotional needs, yet school speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are not typically trained in how to address those needs. We developed a new training (STIRS [SLP Training to Increase Resilience in Students]) to equip elementary school SLPs to embed social-emotional learning (SEL) practices within their routine speech-language sessions with K-3 students with communication disorders. The primary objective of this pilot trial was to evaluate the preliminary effects and feasibility of STIRS.\n' +
      "METHOD: This was a single-blind, parallel two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial with elementary school SLPs within a local education agency in Iowa. At a scheduled professional development meeting, the SLPs were randomly assigned to either the STIRS condition or active control condition (speech assessment of bilingual students). Both conditions involved a one-time 3-hr training. SLPs' attitudes, knowledge, and self-efficacy in addressing SEL with their K-3 students were measured immediately before and after the training. After the training, we also collected data on acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility to inform a future definitive trial.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Twenty SLPs who attended the professional development meeting consented to participate, were randomized by remote web-based allocation, and completed both pretraining and posttraining measures (12 SLPs in the STIRS condition and eight in the active control condition). Compared to the control group, there was a small positive main effect of the STIRS training on SLPs' openness, knowledge, and self-efficacy immediately posttraining. The SLPs in the STIRS condition also reported adequate levels of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the training.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The one-time STIRS training has the potential to increase SLPs' willingness and confidence to support SEL of K-3 students with communication disorders. In a future definitive trial, engagement could be enhanced through more clinical application training. Enrollment challenges may be mitigated by using a different design (e.g., team-based coaching, waitlist control).",

    title: 'The Perceived Value of Interprofessional Practice According to Classroom Teachers, Special Education Teachers, and Speech-Language Pathologists.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: When working with students with speech, language, and communication needs, classroom teachers (CLTs), special education teachers (SETs), and speech-language pathologists (SLPs) must engage in interprofessional practice (IPP). According to the expectancy-value model, IPP adoption is partially contingent on its perceived value. The objective of this study was to analyze whether and how the perceived value of IPP differs across four domains (interest, costs, benefits for the specialist, and benefits for the students) among the three professional groups and the extent to which various factors affect this perception. This study focuses on school-based professionals in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, working under the same administrative authority and in accordance with the same guidelines.\n' +
      'METHOD: A total of 317 staff members from mainstream schools in Bern, Switzerland (142 CLTs, 89 SETs, and 86 SLPs), completed an IPP questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to compare the four domains of perceived values between groups, and structural equation modeling was used to assess the impact of various factors.\n' +
      'RESULTS: SETs showed the most positive perception of IPP across all domains, whereas CLTs and SLPs were less positive. Self-reported competencies in IPP positively influenced the perceived value of CLTs and SLPs; however, perceptions were more negative at the secondary school level for CLTs and SLPs.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Since CLTs, SETs, and SLPs in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, operate under the same administrative guidelines, the differences in perceived value of IPP are attributed to their distinct professional backgrounds and work environments.\n' +

    title: 'Building Capacity in Public Health: Effects of the Pacific Public Health Fellowship Program in the US-Affiliated Islands.',
    abstract: 'CONTEXT: Public health agencies require a competent, well-trained workforce to protect health and meet the specific needs of the communities served. In the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI), geographic and educational barriers, and limited availability of culturally and linguistically appropriate training programs are unique challenges that contribute to public health workforce shortages.\n' +
      'PROGRAM AND IMPLEMENTATION: The Pacific Public Health Fellowship Program (PPHFP) was introduced through a partnership between the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention and the Pacific Island Health Officers Association. It was designed to address barriers to public health workforce development and capacity in USAPI. Established in 2019, PPHFP is a 2-year, full-time training program designed for USAPI residents who are recent college graduates with interests in pursuing careers in public health. The program includes a competency-based training curriculum and field-based projects at participating host sites to address local public health challenges. PPHFP has expanded from 2 fellows in 2021 to 43 fellows in 2024, with each USAPI having hosted fellows.\n' +
      'EVALUATION: All 2021-2023 cohort respondents to the PPHFP exit survey have reported satisfaction with the program, increased knowledge and skills in public health, and readiness to enter the public health workforce. In addition, respondents reported that they have contributed to public health workforce capacity at their local host sites. In total, 16 of 17 graduates from these cohorts have been employed or continued their education in the public health field.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: PPHFP is a successful approach to addressing unique public health workforce challenges in USAPI through recruitment, training, and placement of residents at local host sites. This fellowship program can serve as a model for enhancing public health workforce capacity in other regions and globally.',

    title: 'Integrating Planetary Health Into Residencies: A Vital Step for Medical Education.',
    abstract: "The escalating climate crisis necessitates that health care and medical education adapt to the increasing health impacts of extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and shifting ecosystems. Patients and medical trainees are already confronting the health consequences of climate change, pollution, and environmental degradation, while health care systems grapple with effects on service delivery. These environmental challenges underscore the need for health care and medical education that is resilient and proactive in addressing emerging threats.Planetary health is a field inclusive of the effects of climate change and environmental degradation on human health and the broader systems that sustain life. Many U.S. medical schools have begun integrating planetary health into their curricula. However, without deliberate and scaffolded inclusion of planetary health education throughout graduate medical education, trainees may lack the ability to translate environmental determinants of health into actionable clinical strategies that improve patient outcomes and health care system resilience, as graduate medical education plays a pivotal role in shaping physicians' practice patterns. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), which sets the standard for routine graduate medical education, has the opportunity to help prepare trainees to meet societal needs and equip them for the challenges they will encounter in their medical practice.Incorporating planetary health into the Common Program Requirements would establish a training standard for planetary health, now widely recognized as fundamental to human health. Existing ACGME priorities, such as health equity, quality improvement, systems-based practice, and interdisciplinary collaboration, align with planetary health approaches. The ACGME's endorsement of planetary health education would ensure all residents acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to address the health consequences of climate change and are prepared to practice sustainable health care, thus fostering a health care workforce capable of meeting the needs of patients and delivering resilient, sustainable, and equitable care.",

We applied the Six-Step Model for Competency Framework Development in Healthcare Professions, drawing on targeted literature review and international stakeholder input to draft the framework.\n' +
      'OUTCOMES: The resulting framework includes 3 domains and 7 competency areas defining the knowledge, expertise, and leadership required for Genomics Nurse Educators.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The framework advances genomic nursing education globally, transitioning it from an emerging to an evolving specialty; provides a structured pathway for faculty development, supports integration of genomics into curricula, and promotes education of genomics-informed nurses.',
