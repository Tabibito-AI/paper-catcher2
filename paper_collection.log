    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. These instructional strategies aim to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a tool that can promote substantive student involvement and meaningful learning. (An initial draft of this abstract was produced by ChatGPT 4.0, but GenAI was not used in any other way for this article, other than as an interactive partner within the excerpts as clearly marked.)',

    summary: 'This report details a set of three tasks used in an exploratory study of pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) experiences of task design for the mathematics classroom. The three tasks, which I call the Orange Dot Tasks , were constructed in Desmos, a dynamic geometry environment (DGE), and participants engaged each task through manipulating draggable objects on iPad touchscreens. The purpose of this report is two-fold: one aim is to present the tasks in detail and to elaborate on the intentions behind their design and a second is to present some perspectives of PSTs on these tasks generated through their participation in the study.',

    title: 'Making Tens with Four Hands: Touchscreen-Based Classroom Activity for Early Number Learning',
    summary: 'As schools increasingly embrace embodied learning, there is a growing need to incorporate classroom teaching and learning activities that recognize the body’s role as both an individual and collective resource for cognition and instruction. In response, we present a design for a classroom teaching sequence focused on early number learning, featuring pedagogical activities supported by TouchCounts (TC) and engaged by pairs of children using their four hands. These activities showcase the potential of embodied learning for children to explore concepts such as odd and even numbers, as well as the composition and decomposition of numbers up to and including ten. We elaborate on the functionalities of TC, outline the teaching sequence, and offer episodes of our classroom observations. Specifically, we present three lesson snapshots aimed at first-graders (aged 6 to 7) using a class set of TC, student learning outcomes, and notable observations as students interact with the touchscreen environment. For example, we note that the student pairs used their hands to reinforce, extend, and redirect mathematical ideas; besides, they developed a collective discourse through (gestural) subitizing the number of fingers that they (and their partner) put up (and folded down). This snapshot explicates the collective learning experiences in classroom settings involving pair-work activities and informs existing work on embodied (mathematical) cognition beyond how students learn with their bodies individually.',

    title: 'Understanding Children’s Learning of Part–Whole Relations Using Fingu',
    summary: 'In this article, we investigate the effects of the app Fingu on a child’s understanding of the part-whole concept. Using the Artifact Centric Activity Theory framework, we initially analyse the internalisation and externalisation processes that appear to occur during one child’s use of the app. Based on the learning from this process, we then use other aspects of the framework, in particular the subject-artifact-group triangle, to understand how Fingu might be used productively in mathematics education classrooms. Using a 13-min video of a child playing Fingu as our data source, we analyse how children might, as they learn about part-whole relationships, interact with the game. We also investigate how design principles in creating apps can impact on the experience of using the app in ways that may be unintended by their designers. This work has implications for app designers and for mathematics educators seeking to incorporate digital technologies into mathematics education.',

    title: 'Mothers’ duties and rights when positioned as remote education tutors in Australian distance schooling',
    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Literacy and Financial Education: Private Providers, Public Certification and Political Preferences',
    summary: 'Financial education can influence the level of financial literacy. In many countries public authorities implement financial education policy by means of ex ante certification of both private and public providers of education activities. This article uses political economy, educational marketing and text analysis as complementary tools to offer a positive analysis of such setting. Being financial education a credence good and given the key assumption that financial literacy is a country state–contingent endowment that deteriorates, as a consequence of innovation, the third-party certification can be considered as a strategic governance solution. Yet, when a public agency acts as third-party certifier, political and bureaucratic incentives shape its action. In particular, political activism in financial education can be motivated by financial instability worries. Such theoretical relationship is empirically confirmed applying text analyses, and using financial education narrative as a proxy for activism both for the politicians of the European Parliament and the bureaucrats of the ECB in the period 1997–2024.',

    title: 'Public management of digitalization into the Spanish tourism services: a heterodox analysis',
    summary: "This study is a critical review of public intervention and its management of change with digitalization, applied to Spanish tourism services, as ones of the largest case and most required of attention into the European Union. In comparison with other mainstream papers, this heterodox review is based on the combination of Austrian Economics and Neo-Institutional approaches ( Cornucopists ), with their common theoretical and methodological frameworks. Thus, it is possible to analyze failures and paradoxes in the public intervention, especially with post-COVID recovery policies. The case of the Spanish tourism sector highlights the effect of double bureaucracy, from European institutions and the Spanish Government, affecting its competitiveness and revealing the confirmation of heterodox theorems. Faced with mainstream public intervention guidelines, which usually involve expansive spending and more debt (and New-Malthusian measures), a heterodox mainline solution is offered here, based on the revival of the original sustainability principle, the readjustment effect and the promotion of geek'n'talent education, to facilitate the transition to the Knowledge Economy, where the tourism sector is capable of offering personalized travel experiences due to digitalization.",

    title: 'In pursuit of equity in upper secondary education: the curious case of Ghana’s free senior high school policy',
    summary: 'The Free Senior High School policy is Ghana’s attempt at actualising the SDG 4 global consensus on free upper secondary education. Using grounded theory method, this research scrutinises the Free SHS 2018 policy and strategy document, alongside interviews with policymakers, to answer the question: How does the equity provision ensure fairness in upper secondary education, and what equity blind spots exist? Specifically, the study employed a purposive sampling technique, allowing for the deliberate selection of data sources that ensured the collection of focused, meaningful data aligned with the research goals. The findings underscore a disconnect between the policy’s equity intentions and solutions. For example, the policy highlights that, intersectional differences—such as economic, school-based, gender, and regional factors—persist and drive inequitable access. However, these issues are inadequately addressed because the policy applies cookie-cutter-style economic solutions to all inequity concerns. Policymakers from within, and outside from government, hold diverse perspectives on the impact of this disconnect on sub-populations. The former underscores political and technical accountabilities where increasing numbers of enrolment are equated to equity, while the latter underscores differential policy effect sizes on sub-population to mean inequity. Curiously, the policy has improved access despite the equity conundrum, weak economy, lack of private–public initiatives, declining GDP allocation to education, no selective fee waivers, and neglect of secondary education expansion prerequisites. The paper advocates realigning the policy’s equity dimension with its equity goals.',

    title: 'Work-family trajectories and poverty duration and severity in German working-age households.',
    abstract: 'This study examines how work-family trajectories of households with poverty experience relate to poverty persistence across their working-age life course, using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel from 2007 to 2020 (N=1,518). Work-family trajectories are conceptualised by considering individual- and household-level explanations of poverty. Taking a life course perspective, the study explores sequences of labour market attachment, the extent of low-wage receipt and the needs-to-resource ratio in households across eight years. Methods combine multichannel sequence analysis to identify four clusters of work-family trajectories, and linear regressions to link these clusters to the cumulated length of poverty experiences and the average distance from the at-risk-of-poverty threshold across eight years. Findings reveal that most work-family trajectories among working-age households with poverty experience are dominated by low household work intensity and the presence of children, with trajectories of low-wage receipt forming less prominent patterns. Household histories of low work intensity are linked to increased poverty duration and severity. This relation is even stronger for households that simultaneously experience a high needs-to-resource ratio or frequent low-wage receipt, emphasising the interplay between these two factors and household work intensity. High household work intensity reduces poverty persistence the most, with education identified as an important contextual factor mitigating poverty persistence. Findings suggest to reduce poverty persistence by supporting higher work intensity and regular employment in households with poverty experiences by addressing what prevents individual employment, such as upskilling or reskilling along individual strengths. Such initiatives are particularly important to decrease poverty persistence in families with children.',

    title: 'Designing the Contemporary Implementation of Traditional knowledge and Evidence (CITE) framework to guide the application of traditional knowledge in contemporary health contexts: a Delphi study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The 2018 Declaration of Astana acknowledges the need to include traditional, complementary and integrative health care (TCIH) knowledge and technologies within primary health care. The World Health Assembly has also called member states to integrate TCIH into national healthcare systems. However, little attention has been given to developing supportive resources for this process in practice, policy, research and education.\n' +
      'METHODS: This study employed Delphi methodology to refine a framework for the evaluation and implementation of text-based traditional knowledge in contemporary health contexts. An international sample was recruited of expert participants with experience in a diversity of settings and disciplines. Framework items were retained, removed or modified based on participant consensus agreement on the importance of each item (consensus set at ≥75 per cent agreement), and mapped for comprehensiveness against an implementation framework.\n' +
      'FINDINGS: The initial survey round was completed by 19 participants and the second round by 15 participants. Most participants (n=15) held TCIH qualifications, representing six TCIH professions in total (naturopathy, Western herbal medicine, osteopathy, traditional Chinese and Oriental medicine, Ayurveda, and homeopathy). Participants typically had experience in multiple contexts across clinical practice, research, education and policy development. Consensus was achieved after two rounds and the resulting framework included three sections comprising guiding principles (five items), critical appraisal criteria (three items) and application criteria (eight items).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: As the international health community increasingly recognised the potential value and importance of TCIH knowledge and technologies, this Contemporary Implementation of Traditional knowledge and Evidence (CITE) Framework provides a timely and much-needed practical guide to rigorous and respectful traditional knowledge implementation.',

    title: "Do parents' socioeconomic resources moderate the association between genotype and cognitive skills among children with diverse genetic ancestries?",
    abstract: "Recent research shows that high parental socioeconomic status does not convey the same skill advantage to Black and Latinx children as to white children in the United States due to disadvantages at school for racialised and ethnicised minorities. We extend this literature by asking whether socioeconomic status moderates the association between child genotype and cognitive skills among racialised and ethnicised minorities in the United States. Hence, what we study is whether high socioeconomic status conveys an equal advantage when it comes to the relationship between genotype and cognitive skills. We use data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Using molecular genetic data, we construct a polygenic index for educational attainment and test whether the association between this index and children's cognitive skills is moderated by maternal education and household income in two principal component defined ancestry groups: African ancestries (n=1,551) and Latinx ancestries (n=890). The polygenic index for educational attainment is positively associated with cognitive skills in both groups. In the African ancestries group, this association does not differ by socioeconomic status. In the Latinx ancestries group, the results are mixed. Because our samples are likely underpowered to detect genotype-socioeconomic interactions, our results should be considered suggestive until larger samples of diverse ancestries are available. Advances in genetic research have been skewed towards European ancestry populations, and the broader implication of our study is to eliminate this bias through the collection of large, diverse genotype samples and measuring their genotypes with arrays designed for multi-ancestry populations.",

    title: 'Associations Between Tinnitus and Hearing Loss Among Noise-Exposed Workers in the United States From 1999 to 2020: A Cross-Sectional Study.',
    abstract: 'ImportanceTinnitus is a prevalent condition among noise-exposed workers, with significant implications for hearing health and quality of life. Identifying associated factors can inform prevention and management strategies.ObjectivesTo identify factors associated with tinnitus prevalence among noise-exposed workers and assess the effectiveness of hearing protection in mitigating tinnitus.DesignCross-sectional study.SettingData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys database.ParticipantsThis study included 4931 noise-exposed workers (mean age 48.9 ± 0.3 years). Participants were categorized into speech-frequency hearing loss (SFHL; n = 1032, mean age 67.2 ± 0.4 years) and high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL; n = 1634, mean age 62.9 ± 0.3 years) groups based on hearing threshold levels.Intervention or ExposuresNoise exposure duration, hearing loss severity, demographics, and medical history. Hearing protection usage was assessed for its effectiveness in preventing tinnitus.Main Outcome MeasuresPrimary outcome: tinnitus prevalence. Associations were analyzed using logistic regression, with factors including self-reported noise exposure, hearing loss severity, demographics, and medical history.ResultTinnitus prevalence was 32.85% in the group with SFHL and 29.99% in the group with HFHL. Prolonged noise exposure and greater hearing loss severity were associated with tinnitus in both groups. Hearing protection usage was potentially linked to a lower tinnitus prevalence in HFHL but not in SFHL. For SFHL, univariate analysis showed lower tinnitus prevalence in older age and females, while Caucasian ethnicity and higher income were associated with higher prevalence. Multivariate analysis indicated that older age was positively associated with tinnitus ( < .05). In HFHL, factors such as higher BMI, higher educational level, and elevated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) scores were significantly associated with tinnitus prevalence.ConclusionsProlonged noise exposure and hearing loss severity among noise-exposed workers were associated with tinnitus prevalence in SFHL and HFHL. Hearing protection showed tendency to reduce tinnitus prevalence in HFHL but had a limited effect in SFHL. Higher BMI, higher education levels, and elevated PHQ9 scores were significantly associated with tinnitus in HFHL, warranting further research into protective strategies.RelevanceFuture studies should explore alternative protective strategies for SFHL patients and refine tinnitus prevention approaches in noise-exposed workers.',

      'METHODS: Data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2018. Prevalence, number, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in early-onset and late-onset T2D were assessed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: There was a clear and steady upward trend in early-onset T2D, although the prevalence and number of late-onset T2D were higher than early-onset. The average loss of DALYs per capita (DALYs/per) in the early-onset T2D was higher than that in the late-onset. DALYs/per is higher in males than females in both early- and late-onset T2D groups. People living at or below the poverty line and those with education of high school and below had a higher DALYs/per of early-onset T2D. Among individuals with early-onset T2D, the DALYs/per loss was higher in the non-obesity group.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: There was a clear upward trend in the prevalence of early-onset T2D, and the loss of DALYs/per in early-onset T2D was higher than that in late-onset T2D. The attribution risk factors, like sex, education levels, income levels, and body mass index, for the burden of early-onset T2D varied, and measures need to be taken to target different populations.',

    title: 'How emotional labor leads to turnover intention: the mediating role of job burnout and the moderating role of social support among rural physical education teachers in China.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To examine the mediating role of job burnout in the relationship between emotional labor strategies and turnover intention among rural physical education (PE) teachers in China, and to explore the moderating effect of social support in this mechanism.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1,761 rural PE teachers using validated self-report scales. Structural equation modeling (SEM) via AMOS 26.0 was used to test the mediating effects of job burnout, followed by moderated mediation analyses using PROCESS macro Model 7, controlling for gender, age, teaching tenure, and education level.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Job burnout significantly mediated the associations between all three emotional labor strategies and turnover intention. Surface acting showed both direct and indirect effects, while deep acting and genuine expression were associated with turnover intention only through burnout. Additionally, social support moderated the relationship between surface acting and burnout, but not for the other two strategies.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Emotional labor strategies influence turnover intention both directly and indirectly through job burnout, while social support serves as a key buffering resource against the negative impact of surface acting on burnout. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing emotional labor management strategies and strengthening social support networks to enhance teacher wellbeing and promote educational equity in rural schools.',

    title: 'Developing positive behavioral skills among adolescents participating in basketball sports schools.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a positive behavior skills development program on adolescents who participate in basketball sports schools.\n' +
      "METHODS: Sixty-two adolescent athletes (Mage 15.83 ± 0.37) took part in this educational experiment. Participants were randomly selected from 2 basketball sports schools chosen from a list of basketball sports schools and divided into experimental ( = 30) and control ( = 32) groups. The experimental group participants were subjected to the effect of the positive behavior skills development program, which aimed to develop positive behavior skills among adolescents participating in basketball sports schools, including taking responsibility, positive self-evaluation, prosocial behavior with teammates, prosocial behavior with opponents, taking social responsibility, cooperation, assertiveness, empathy, self-control, ability to evaluate and convey emotions, ability to utilize one's positive emotional experience, ability to comprehend and analyze emotions, and ability to control emotions. Positive behavior skills development activities were conducted by one of the researchers together with the sports school coaches. At the beginning and end of the educational experiment, participants from both the experimental and control groups completed the following questionnaires: Personal and Social Responsibility Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, The Prosocial and Antisocial Behavior in Sport Scale, Social Skills Rating System-Secondary Student form, and Schutte Self-Report Inventory.\n" +

    title: 'The impact of songs with prosocial lyrics on implicit cognition and prosocial behavior: a prospective event-related brain potential study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Music with prosocial lyrics is a significant area of study in music psychology. Based on the General Learning Model, such music can effectively enhance prosocial behaviors. However, little is known about the neural correlates of the impact on prosocial behavior of short-term exposure to music with prosocial lyrics. Previous research has primarily used self-report measures to explore the relationship between music and prosocial cognition and behavior. However, these measures can be influenced by social desirability biases when dealing with sensitive issues such as moral behavior. The study of implicit cognition can effectively avoid these biases and has thus attracted widespread attention.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study is the first to investigate the electrophysiological characteristics of the relationship between exposure to music with prosocial lyrics and enhanced altruistic behavior and to elucidate the effects of such music on implicit prosocial cognition.\n' +
      "METHODS: This laboratory study will recruit 45 college students, who will be tasked with listening to either music with prosocial lyrics or neutral music. We will then use the Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT) paradigm combined with event-related potentials (ERP) to investigate the impact of music with prosocial lyrics on participants' implicit prosocial cognition and further reveal the predictive power of implicit cognition on prosocial behavior (measured by assessing the level of voluntary unpaid participation in subsequent experiments).\n" +
      'RESULTS: The findings of this study will provide neuroscientific evidence on how music with prosocial lyrics influences prosocial behavior through cognitive processes and clarify the effectiveness of music with prosocial lyrics in enhancing implicit prosocial cognition and behavior. In addition, these findings will not only deepen the understanding of the relationship between music and social behavior but also provide theoretical foundations and practical guidance for education, psychological interventions, and strategies to improve social behavior, thereby promoting the application of music in fostering social harmony.',

      'BACKGROUND: EGS involves complex decision-making of operative and nonoperative management. Risk calculators can aid in shared decision-making and informed consent.\n' +
      'METHODS: We performed semi-structured interviews among emergency surgeons within 1 healthcare system to explore perceptions of risk calculators in EGS. Interviews were completed until thematic saturation, transcribed, coded in duplicate, and analyzed using inductive analysis within a modified grounded theory framework to generate theory regarding surgeon perceptions of risk calculators in EGS.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among 20 interviewees, the mean age was 45. We identified dominant themes related to the concerns of and benefits of using risk calculators within EGS, both in situations of clear and unclear best treatment options. Surgeons questioned risk calculator validity and noted that a lack of health numeracy can limit their use. Risk calculators were seen as helpful for communication, consensus building, informed consent, and litigation mitigation. The ideal risk calculator should have low activation energy for use, incorporate relevant data and accurate prognostication, and provide actionable, easily interpretable output. Education for providers and patients on risk calculator availability and use is necessary.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Although surgeons may initially question the data produced by risk calculators in EGS, they identify several potential virtues to their bedside use when optimal treatment options are and are not clear. The ideal risk calculator for use in EGS should be convenient and relevant. Future studies are needed to explore patient perceptions and to directly observe patterns of risk calculator use.',

    title: 'Patterns and Correlates of Tobacco Use Among PLWH in Viet Nam: A Cross-Sectional Analysis.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The use of multiple tobacco products may increase nicotine dependence and reduce success in quitting. In Viet Nam, the prevalence of dual cigarette and waterpipe use is high, yet the characteristics of dual users, particularly among people living with HIV (PLWH) in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) are underexplored. This paper describes patterns and correlates of tobacco use among PLWH in Viet Nam.\n' +
      "METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis utilized baseline survey data from a randomized controlled trial. Participants (n = 672) were ≥ 18 years old, current cigarette smokers, and receiving care at one of 13 HIV clinics in Ha Noi. Tobacco use pattern (cigarette-only vs dual waterpipe and cigarette use) was determined by self-reported use in the past 7 days. Sociodemographic characteristics, health status, household smoking rules, substance use, and perceived smoking risks were examined using bivariate analysis, with Wilcoxon's rank sum test and Pearson's Chi-sq tests used to assess statistical significance.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Half of the sample (50.3%) reported dual waterpipe and cigarette use. Dual use was significantly associated with a lower level of education, lower annual income, and poorer health compared to cigarette-only smokers. Dual users were less likely to report a no-smoking household policy, and more likely to have a higher level of nicotine dependence. Participants from both user groups perceived waterpipe smoking as less harmful compared to cigarette smoking.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of dual tobacco use among PLWH in Viet Nam. Understanding the characteristics of dual users is critical for developing comprehensive tobacco control policies and cessation strategies tailored to this population in Viet Nam and other LMICs.',
