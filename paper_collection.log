    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +
      'national income model, government-purchases multiplier and tax multiplier.',

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'educational attainment can predict upward income and occupational mobility even\n' +
      'within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin\n' +
      'Longitudinal Study (WLS), I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment\n' +
      'predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when\n' +
      'respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about\n' +
      '53 years of age), conditional on 1974 values of these variables and a range of\n' +
      'covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status,\n' +
      'is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is\n' +
      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +
      'our understanding of longitudinal inequality and shed light on the sources of\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +
      'propose a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of\n' +
      'education and remains as a significant predictor of economic growth when tested\n' +
      'with both cross-section data and panel data. We argue that future research on\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +

      'reproduces all peaceful data from 1800 to date without adjustable parameter. It\n' +
      'has full forecasting power since the decisive parameters are constants of the\n' +

    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +

      'to enable the students to understand deeper the principles and methods\n' +

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use.

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    abstract: "Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies have created new possibilities that redefine the scope of modern education, allowing for the creation of entirely immersive and engaging learning environments. With the rapid adoption of these technologies to enhance educational environments, the importance of having methods to measure the effectiveness of teaching performance in such immersive settings has become increasingly crucial. This study introduces a new framework that integrates the circular interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (CIVIF) framework and the evaluation based on the distance from average solution (EDAS) method to assess teaching effectiveness in VR and AR classrooms. The proposed framework assesses various pedagogical strategies, learner engagement levels, and technological efficacy in VR/AR classrooms, taking into account the uncertainties inherent in these evaluations. The proposed framework is validated through experimental case studies in VR/AR classrooms, which demonstrate that collaborative AR projects are the most effective approach, followed by gamified learning and storytelling. The findings confirm that this hybrid approach provides greater objectivity and scalability, offering actionable insights for educators and administrators to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement within a given methodology. These results demonstrate the model's ability to provide insight into enhanced teaching methodologies in immersive learning contexts. This research presents a transformative tool for education stakeholders, leading to data-driven increases in teaching effectiveness specific to the needs of next-generation classrooms.",

    title: 'The impact of CNN MHAM-enhanced WRF and BPNN models for user behavior prediction.',
    abstract: "To address the challenge of user behavior prediction on artificial intelligence (AI)-based online education platforms, this study proposes a novel ensemble model. The model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (MHAM), Weighted Random Forest (WRF), and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), forming an integrated architecture that enhances WRF and BPNN with CNN and MHAM. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved BPNN model, when combined with WRF, outperforms individual models in predicting user behavior. Specifically, the integrated model achieves a prediction accuracy of 92.3% on the test dataset-approximately 5% higher than that of the traditional BPNN. For imbalanced datasets, it attains a recall rate of 89.7%, significantly surpassing the unweighted random forest's 82.4%. The model also achieves an F1-score of 90.8%, reflecting strong overall performance in terms of both precision and recall. Overall, the proposed method effectively leverages the classification capabilities of WRF and the nonlinear fitting power of BPNN, substantially enhancing the accuracy and reliability of user behavior prediction, and offering valuable support for optimizing AI-driven online education platforms.",

    title: 'Education and training of surgical residents in upper gastrointestinal surgery: a European survey.',
    abstract: "Educating and training young surgeons is a complex challenge that requires a structured pathway. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) surgery is becoming a highly attractive subspecialty, yet it is not universally recognized. Currently, there are no standardized guidelines or curricula for UGI surgical training across Europe and a wide disparity among countries remains. This study aims to focus on the current European landscape from the perspective of both trainees and trainers, and to provide a foundation for developing effective guidelines for education and training of surgical residents. We conducted a cross-sectional survey study with targeted questions about various aspects of managing patients with UGI diseases, including preoperative investigations, surgical interventions, interventional endoscopy, and postoperative follow-up. We also assessed the availability of training resources and extracurricular activities. Distinct questionnaires were distributed independently to trainees and trainers. The overall response rate was 35.6%. Most trainees and trainers recognized the need for dedicated courses in UGI surgery and emphasized the importance of learning through video materials. The survey revealed that surgeons are often unfamiliar with UGI endoscopy and functional esophageal function studies. We analyzed residents' direct involvement in three surgical procedures: anti-reflux surgery, gastrectomy, and esophagectomy. Residents expressed a lack of confidence in executing certain surgical steps. Both trainers and residents expressed preference for extracurricular, hands-on courses focused on UGI surgery but reported insufficient opportunities for such training. This survey highlights significant gaps and limitations of UGI training for surgical residents in Europe. Efforts toward standardization and development of specific guidelines and recommendations are required to enhance education in UGI surgery.",

    title: 'Semantic web ontology for structured knowledge representation and clinical decision support in eye diseases.',
    abstract: 'Vision is a vital sense that allows people to interact with their surroundings and carry out tasks efficiently while maintaining safety and independence. At least 2.2 billion people globally suffer from blindness or vision impairment, of which more than 1 billion cases are avoidable or untreated because they lack access to eye care services. In ophthalmology, there are numerous challenges in knowledge organization and management, mainly due to the complexity of eye diseases. Ontologies are used as excellent tools for organizing and managing complicated information due to their structured representations of domain knowledge and to make data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. We have developed an ontology, that is, Eye Disease Ontology (EDO), for the most common eye diseases as a resource that helps in data extraction and analysis for the general public and medical professionals. EDO is a comprehensive and systematic knowledge representation system that categorizes and organizes information about commonly occurring eye diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, etc, and connects it to vital details such as symptoms, causes, risk factors, diagnostic tests, and treatment options. The significant metrics of EDO include 566 classes, 16 object properties, 12 data properties, and 119 instances. In this study, the ontology of eye diseases has the potential to improve clinical diagnosis, advance research, and enrich medical education, while improving patient care. This ontology was created using the NeOn technique in the Protégé/OWL environment. Several competency questions were created to meet the demands of various stakeholders, and the ontology was validated using SPARQL queries, the Hermit Reasoner, and the OOPS Pitfalls Scanner. In addition, we develop comprehensive documentation for EDO to promote reuse and emphasise the importance of reuse in future applications.',

    title: 'Cross-modal gated feature enhancement for multimodal emotion recognition in conversations.',
    abstract: 'Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC), which involves identifying the emotional state of each utterance within a dialogue, plays a vital role in developing empathetic artificial intelligence systems. In practical applications, such as video-based recruitment interviews, customer service, health monitoring, intelligent personal assistants, and online education, ERC can facilitate the analysis of emotional cues, improve decision-making processes, and enhance user interaction and satisfaction. Current multimodal emotion recognition research faces several challenges, such as ineffective emotional information extraction from single modalities, underused complementary features, and inter-modal redundancy. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a cross-modal gated attention mechanism for emotion recognition. The method extracts and fuses visual, textual, and auditory features to enhance accuracy and stability. A cross-modal guided gating mechanism is designed to strengthen single-modality features and utilize a third modality to improve bimodal feature fusion, boosting multimodal feature representation. Furthermore, a cross-modal distillation loss function is proposed to reduce redundancy and improve feature discrimination. This function employs a dual-supervision mechanism with teacher and student models, ensuring consistency in single-modal, bimodal, and trimodal feature representations. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and comparable F1 scores than existing approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing multimodal dependencies and balancing modality contributions.',

    title: 'The relationship between liver stiffness, fat content measured by liver elastography, and coronary artery disease: a study based on the NHANES database.',
    abstract: 'This study aimed to investigate the relationship between liver stiffness measurements (LSM), controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A total of 12,684 American populations who underwent health examinations were included from the NHANES database spanning 2017-2020 (pre-pandemic) and 2021-2023. Logistic regression was employed to analyze the associations between LSM, CAP, and CHD. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression was used to evaluate the dose-response relationship between LSM, CAP, and CHD. Stratified analyses were performed according to age, sex, race, education level, income, BMI, blood pressure, hepatitis B surface antibody, and cholesterol to explore potential interactions and identify specific subpopulations at risk. Finally, predictive models were developed using logistic regression, decision trees, XGBoost classifiers, and neural networks to assess the predictive value of LSM and CAP for CHD risk. During the study period, 12,684 participants were included, of whom 539 (4.24%) were diagnosed with CHD. After adjusting for confounders, both LSM and CAP were found to be significantly positively associated with CHD risk in U.S. adults. Subgroup analyses revealed a significant positive association between LSM and CHD incidence in participants stratified by race and blood parameters (interaction P-value < 0.050). Additionally, sex, age, and lipid profiles showed a significant positive correlation between CAP and CHD risk. Predictive models also indicated a positive relationship between LSM, CAP, and CHD risk. Both LSM and CAP were nonlinearly and positively associated with CHD risk, highlighting the importance of maintaining lower levels of liver stiffness and fat as a potential preventive strategy for CHD.',
