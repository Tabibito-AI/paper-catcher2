    title: '100% renewable electricity in Japan',
    summary: 'Japan has committed to carbon neutrality by 2050. Emissions from the\n' +
      'electricity sector amount to 42% of the total. Solar photovoltaics (PV) and\n' +
      'wind comprise three quarters of global net capacity additions because of low\n' +
      'and falling prices. This provides an opportunity for Japan to make large\n' +
      'reductions in emissions while also reducing its dependence on energy imports.\n' +
      'This study shows that Japan has 14 times more solar and offshore wind resources\n' +
      'than needed to supply 100% renewable electricity. A 40 year hourly energy\n' +
      "balance model is presented of Japan's electricity system using historical data.\n" +
      'Pumped hydro energy storage, high voltage interconnection and dispatchable\n' +
      'capacity (hydro, biomass and hydrogen energy) are included to balance variable\n' +
      'generation and demand. Differential evolution is used to find the least-cost\n' +
      'solution under various constraints. The levelized cost of electricity is found\n' +
      'to be USD 86 per MWh for a PV-dominated system, and USD 110 per MWh for a\n' +
      'wind-dominated system. These costs can be compared with the average system\n' +
      'prices on the spot market in Japan of USD 102 per MWh. In summary, Japan can be\n' +
      'self-sufficient for electricity supply at competitive costs.',

    title: 'Submeter-level Land Cover Mapping of Japan',
    summary: 'Deep learning has shown promising performance in submeter-level mapping\n' +
      'tasks; however, the annotation cost of submeter-level imagery remains a\n' +
      'challenge, especially when applied on a large scale. In this paper, we present\n' +

    title: 'Population changes in residential clusters in Japan',
    summary: 'Population dynamics in urban and rural areas are different. Understanding\n' +
      'factors that contribute to local population changes has various socioeconomic\n' +

We conducted statistical modelling to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of infections, along with the infections’ timeline. The estimated asymptomatic proportion was 17.9% (95% credible interval (CrI): 15.5–20.2%). Most infections occurred before the quarantine start.',

    title: 'Public responses to the novel 2019 coronavirus (2019‐nCoV) in Japan: Mental health consequences and target populations',
    abstract: 'In December 2019, cases of life-threatening pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the source of infection. The number of reported cases has rapidly increased in Wuhan as well as other Chinese cities. The virus has also been identified in other parts of the world. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease a ‘public health emergency of international concern.’ As of 3 February 2020, the Chinese government had reported 17 205 confirmed cases in Mainland China, and the WHO had reported 146 confirmed cases in 23 countries outside China. The virus has not been contained within Wuhan, and other major cities in China are likely to experience localized outbreaks. Foreign cities with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicenters without careful public health interventions. In Japan, economic impacts and social disruptions have been reported. Several Japanese individuals who were on Japanese-government-chartered airplanes from Wuhan to Japan were reported as coronavirus-positive. Also, human-to-human transmission was confirmed in Nara Prefecture on 28 January 2020. Since then, the public has shown anxiety-related behaviors and there has been a significant shortage of masks and antiseptics in drug stores. The economic impact has been substantial. Stock prices have dropped in China and Japan, and other parts of the world are also showing some synchronous decline. As of 3 February 2020, no one had died directly from coronavirus infection in Japan. Tragically, however, a 37-year-old government worker who had been in charge of isolated returnees died from apparent suicide. This is not the first time that the Japanese people have experienced imperceptible-agent emergencies – often dubbed as ‘CBRNE’ (i.e., chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives). Japan has endured two atomic bombings in 1945, the sarin gas attacks in 1995, the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, and the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011: all of which carried fear and risk associated with unseen agents. All of these events provoked social disruption. Overwhelming and sensational news headlines and images added anxiety and fear to these situations and fostered rumors and hyped information as individuals filled in the absence of information with rumors. The affected people were subject to societal rejection, discrimination, and stigmatization. Fukushima survivors tend to attribute physical changes to the event (regardless of actual exposure) and have decreased perceived health, which is associated with decreased life expectancy. Fear of the unknown raises anxiety levels in healthy individuals as well as those with preexisting mental health conditions. For example, studies of the 2001 anthrax letter attacks in the USA showed long-term mental health adversities as well as lowered health perception of the infected employees and responders. Public fear manifests as discrimination, stigmatization, and scapegoating of specific populations, authorities, and scientists. As we write this letter, the coronavirus emergency is rapidly evolving. Nonetheless, we can more or less predict expected mental/physical health consequences and the most vulnerable populations. First, peoples’ emotional responses will likely include extreme fear and uncertainty. Moreover, negative societal behaviors will be often driven by fear and distorted perceptions of risk. These experiences might evolve to include a broad range of public mental health concerns, including distress reactions (insomnia, anger, extreme fear of illness even in those not exposed), health risk behaviors (increased use of alcohol and tobacco, social isolation), mental health disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, somatization), and lowered perceived health. It is essential for mental health professionals to provide necessary support to those exposed and to those who deliver care. Second, particular effort must be directed to vulnerable populations, which include: (i) the infected and ill patients, their families, and colleagues; (ii) Chinese individuals and communities; (iii) individuals with pre-existing mental/physical conditions; and, last but not least, (iv) health-care and aid workers, especially nurses and physicians working directly with ill or quarantined persons. If nothing else, the death of the government quarantine worker must remind us to recognize the extent of psychological stress associated with imperceptible agent emergencies and to give paramount weight to the integrity and rights of vulnerable populations.',

    title: 'Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Japan: JSH Consensus Statements and Recommendations 2021 Update',
    abstract: 'The Clinical Practice Manual for Hepatocellular Carcinoma was published based on evidence confirmed by the Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Hepatocellular Carcinoma along with consensus opinion among a Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH) expert panel on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Since the JSH Clinical Practice Guidelines are based on original articles with extremely high levels of evidence, expert opinions on HCC management in clinical practice or consensus on newly developed treatments are not included. However, the practice manual incorporates the literature based on clinical data, expert opinion, and real-world clinical practice currently conducted in Japan to facilitate its use by clinicians. Alongside each revision of the JSH Guidelines, we issued an update to the manual, with the first edition of the manual published in 2007, the second edition in 2010, the third edition in 2015, and the fourth edition in 2020, which includes the 2017 edition of the JSH Guideline. This article is an excerpt from the fourth edition of the HCC Clinical Practice Manual focusing on pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of HCC. It is designed as a practical manual different from the latest version of the JSH Clinical Practice Guidelines. This practice manual was written by an expert panel from the JSH, with emphasis on the consensus statements and recommendations for the management of HCC proposed by the JSH expert panel. In this article, we included newly developed clinical practices that are relatively common among Japanese experts in this field, although all of their statements are not associated with a high level of evidence, but these practices are likely to be incorporated into guidelines in the future. To write this article, coauthors from different institutions drafted the content and then critically reviewed each other’s work. The revised content was then critically reviewed by the Board of Directors and the Planning and Public Relations Committee of JSH before publication to confirm the consensus statements and recommendations. The consensus statements and recommendations presented in this report represent measures actually being conducted at the highest-level HCC treatment centers in Japan. We hope this article provides insight into the actual situation of HCC practice in Japan, thereby affecting the global practice pattern in the management of HCC.',

    title: 'Habitat use and abundance of an introduced population of the Japanese weasel (Mustela itatsi): Comparison with the native population.',
    abstract: 'Understanding habitat use and abundance is essential for elucidating the impact of invasive species. Invasive carnivores affect ecosystems by preying on native animals. In Japan, the Japanese weasel (Mustela itatsi) is native to the mainland but has been intentionally introduced to many small islands, including Miyakejima Island. We investigated the habitat use and abundance of invasive non-native Japanese weasels on Miyakejima Island via fecal surveys, and for comparison, performed similar surveys for their native conspecifics on Izu-Oshima Island. We constructed a generalized linear mixed model and estimated fecal abundance across the entire island based on the effect of vegetation type on their abundance. On Miyakejima Island, deciduous broadleaf and bamboo forests had positive effects on weasel abundance, whereas grasslands had a negative effect. Conversely, on Izu-Oshima Island, bare ground had a negative effect. Further, the estimated average fecal abundance across Miyakejima and Izu-Ohshima Islands, considering vegetation type, were 7.44 and 4.89 feces samples per km, respectively, suggesting that weasels are well adapted to Miyakejima Island. We also analyzed the fecal DNA of weasels in a specific area on Miyakejima Island and estimated non-native weasel density at 20 individuals per km2 (95% CI: 4.9-80) using genetic capture-recapture methods in the area. These findings enhance understanding regarding non-native species and may facilitate the formulation of countermeasures for their control.',

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Walking is a fundamental daily activity representing health status and physical condition. The number of steps taken in a given time period is widely used in research areas such as aging, geriatrics, gerontology, public health, and preventive medicine. However, the underlying mechanisms of step counts are not well understood.\n' +

    title: 'Diverse Roles and Characteristics of Academic Research Organizations in Japan: Results of A Questionnaire-Based Study.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Clinical trials in Japan are governed by three regulations: Japanese Good Clinical Practice (J-GCP), the Clinical Trials Act, and the Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Biological Research Involving Human Subjects. Academic research organizations (AROs) are non-profit entities established to support clinician-scientists in conducting rigorous and high-quality clinical trials. However, Japan's unique decentralized clinical trial system has resulted in relatively small AROs with diverse roles. Additionally, work style reforms among Japanese physicians pose challenges for allocating time to research. This study aimed to assess the demographics, activities, and roles of AROs in Japan.\n" +
      "METHODS: We distributed a questionnaire survey to 31 AROs in Japan between October and December 2023. The survey collected data on organizational mission, vision, annual planning, clinical trial support, the number of supported studies, financial independence, and management of researchers' working hours.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Responses were received from 20 AROs (64.5%), including five public university hospitals and two clinical research core hospitals. The median staff size was 26.7 (range: 2-80), with public university hospitals reporting a median of 22.6 (range: 1449). Y-NEXT had a larger staff size (53.4) compared with other public university hospitals but fewer than clinical research core hospitals (median: 78.5). Thirteen AROs (65.0%) reported having organizational missions, and 25.0% were financially independent. Effort allocation for staff varied among institutions, and six AROs (30.0%) managed researchers' working hours.\n" +
      "CONCLUSION: The roles and ultimate goals of AROs vary across institutions, highlighting the need for alignment with each institution's clinical research priorities and principles.",

    title: 'Lack of association between chronological age and fisher group and poor outcomes in older patients with severe-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a nationwide registry study in Japan.',
    abstract: 'Older age and Fisher group scores predict poor outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, among aging societies, treatment indications and decisions in older patients with severe-grade aSAH (World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies [WFNS] grade IV or V) remain poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to identify the risk factors associated with poor outcomes in non-older and older patients with severe-grade aSAH. We analyzed a database of patients with aSAH treated between April 2007 and December 2019 in Japan and divided them into either the non-older (< 75 years) or older group (age ≥ 75 years) to identify factors associated with poor outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score [mRS] 3-6) at discharge. The data analyzed included patient demographics, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, Fisher group, WFNS grade, treatment method, and mRS score at discharge. Among the 5,095 patients, 1,303 (986 non-older and 317 older) were classified as having severe-grade aSAH. In non-older patients, chronological age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.05) and Fisher groups 3 and 4 were associated with poor outcomes as compared with Fisher group 1 + 2 (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.59-5.58 and OR, 5.49; 95% CI, 2.86-10.54, respectively). However, chronological age and Fisher groups 3 and 4 were not associated with poor outcomes in older patients with severe-grade aSAH. This study suggests that outcomes in older patients with severe-grade aSAH cannot be predicted in the same manner as in non-older patients. Further research on potential prognostic factors, such as biological age, is warranted. Clinical trial number Not applicable.',

    title: 'South Korea is the center for the origin and emanation of soybean mosaic virus with Bayesian phylogeographic inference.',
    abstract: 'Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is one of the most serious viral pathogens, causing reductions in soybean yield worldwide. Using more than 350 time-stamped SMV coat protein encoding gene sequences from more than a dozen countries and regions in Central Asia, East Asia, North America, South America, and Western Europe, we investigated the phylodynamics of SMV to understand the origin and dispersal of the virus via Bayesian phylogeographic inference. Our analysis revealed that the most recent common SMV ancestor occurred in approximately 1511 (95% credibility interval, 1075-1848) Common Era, and the evolutionary rate of the coat protein gene was 3.751 × 10 substitutions/site/year (95% credibility interval, 2.694 × 10-4.879 × 10). Our results suggest that the SMV population may have originated in South Korea and that South Korea has been the major center for the dissemination of SMV. The virus first began to emigrate from Korea to China in the late 17th century, and it took more than 150 years to spread from South Korea to Japan. However, after the 20th century, SMV spread from South Korea to South America, North America, and Western Europe. Furthermore, our results suggest that the migration history of SMV may be related to important human historical events.IMPORTANCESoybean mosaic virus (SMV) is a pathogen that severely affects soybean production areas around the world and can cause up to an 86% reduction in soybean yield. This article provides a comprehensive reconstruction of the phylogeographic history of SMV. Our results revealed the geographic origin and migration history of SMV on a global scale and that the migration history of SMV is correlated with human factors. These results have important implications for the sustainable management of soybean production in the field.',

    title: 'The first nationwide epidemiological survey of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis in Japan.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO)/chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory disorder characterised by aseptic inflammation of bone tissue. The number of patients and the clinical picture of CNO/CRMO in Japan is unknown; therefore, we conducted the first nationwide epidemiological survey.\n' +
      'METHODS: In the primary survey, the number of patients diagnosed with CNO/CRMO between 2015 and 2019 in paediatrics, rheumatology, orthopaedic surgery and dermatology departments of various institutions was investigated. In the second survey, the clinical pictures of these patients were assessed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The primary survey reported 289 patients, and the estimated number of patients nationwide was 434 (95% confidence interval, 367-501). The second survey analysed 205 patients. The median number of radiological bone lesions was three and the bone affected most frequently was the tibia. Tumour necrosis factor inhibitors showed higher efficacy and lower relapse rates than NSAIDs or bisphosphonates. Cases that responded to tocilizumab and canakinumab were also reported. Earlier diagnosis was associated with higher rates of symptom- or drug-free status at the last follow-up visit.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: This is the first nationwide study in Japan, and one of the largest multi-centre studies worldwide, to provide comprehensive epidemiological data about CNO/CRMO.',

    title: 'Risk factors in patients treated with surgical drainage for rhinogenic intracranial complications: a nationwide study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Data on risk factors for rhinogenic intracranial complications (RICs) including cerebral abscess have been limited. Using a nationwide database, the aim was to identify the factors related to mortality and delayed discharge.\n' +
      'METHODOLOGY: Data of 326 patients between 2012 and 2022 were extracted from a Japanese inpatient database. The main outcome was survival at discharge. In a subgroup analysis of the 316 surviving patients, the outcome was delayed discharge.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The mortality rate was 3.1%. Logistic regression analyses identified intracerebral complications more than one surgical intervention and consciousness level evaluated by the Japan Coma Scale (JCS): JCS I and JCS≥ II as risk factors for mortality. Concurrent interventions of intracranial and sinonasal drainage was identified as a factor associated with decreased risk.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Although RICs are rare, with decreasing mortality due to progress in imaging and clinical strategies, they remain the most severe complications of rhinosinusitis. Subdural and/or intracerebral abscess, consciousness level at admission, and more than one surgical intervention were found to be risk factors for mortality. Conversely, concurrent interventions, intracranial and sinonasal drainage, contributed to reducing this risk.',

    title: 'Global research trends on exercise and circadian rhythm: A bibliometric analysis.',
    abstract: `Recent advancements in the field of exercise and circadian rhythms have brought attention to the potential for tailored exercise strategies based on individual biological rhythms, aiming to optimize both health and performance, yet there is a lack of bibliometric analysis within this specific area of research. This study seeks to provide an extensive insight into the knowledge structure and primary research focuses on the correlation between exercise and circadian rhythms using bibliometric analysis. Publications pertinent to exercise and circadian rhythms were sourced from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. Utilizing VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the R package "bibliometrix," a thorough bibliometric analysis was conducted. The analysis encompassed publications from 83 countries and 2025 institutions focusing on exercise and circadian rhythms. Leading contributors included the USA, England, France, Japan, and Germany, with an increasing number of publications annually. Notable institutions like Liverpool John Moores University, Univ Sfax, Brigham Women's Hosp, and Univ Milan ranked among the top contributors. Chronobiology International emerged as the most popular journal in this domain. These publications were attributed to 4402 authors, with Thomas Reilly and Greg Atkinson receiving the most citations, particularly Reilly being the most co-cited author. Dominant research topics included circadian rhythm, quality, skeletal muscle, and entrainment, while emerging hotspots comprised sports performance, mental health validity, older adults, and the sleep-wake cycle. This study marks the first comprehensive bibliometric analysis summarizing research trends and developments in exercise and circadian rhythms. This collection pinpoints the latest research frontiers and promising avenues, acting as a valuable resource for researchers investigating the connection between exercise and circadian rhythms.`,

    title: 'Clinical Manifestations in 32 Cases of Mpox Infection: A Retrospective Study in a Single Dermatology Clinic in Japan.',
    abstract: 'Mpox, a zoonotic orthopox virus, has re-emerged globally since May 2022. In Tokyo, 168 cases were reported in 2023. About 20% were diagnosed in our department. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 32 mpox patients diagnosed in our department in 2023. A retrospective study was conducted using medical records. All cases were confirmed for the diagnosis of mpox by PCR testing using skin samples. The six items were examined: patient background, presumed route of infection, type and site of skin eruption, clinical symptoms other than skin eruption, comorbid infectious diseases, and clinical outcome. All patients were male (median age: 39.5 years) and identified as men who have sex with men (MSM), with 30 reporting recent same-sex sexual activity. Vesicles or small blisters and pustules were the most common eruptions, primarily on the trunk and extremities. Fever occurred in 26 cases, and penile edema was observed in four cases. The HIV-positive rate was approximately 84%, with 53% of patients having a history of both syphilis and hepatitis B. Most cases were observed without treatment with full recovery. When seeing a patient suspected of mpox, it would be recommended to inquire about a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and to test for them even if there is no prior STI history.',
