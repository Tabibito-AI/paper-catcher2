    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +
      'Linear amplification yields S-functions as only analytic solutions.\n' +

      'reproduces all peaceful data from 1800 to date without adjustable parameter. It\n' +

    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +

      'expanding research field of econophysics even on the undergraduate level and 2.\n' +
      'to enable the students to understand deeper the principles and methods\n' +

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    title: 'Measuring digital literacy across ages and over time: Development and validation of a performance-based assessment',
    summary: 'Measuring digital literacy (DL) across ages and tracking its growth over time have remained challenging in the area of digital literacy assessment. The current analysis reports on the psychometric properties of a performance-based Digital Literacy Assessment (DLA) instrument grounded in the DigComp 2.1 framework. Utilising a longitudinal cohort study design, the DLA was administered to Hong Kong students across three age cohorts, from lower primary to upper secondary, over a two-year period. Data were collected in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2021, during the pandemic. The analysis provides validity and reliability evidence for using the DLA in longitudinal studies to assess DL from late childhood through late adolescence. The results further suggest that students’ DL improved with grade level, with secondary students outperforming primary students but also displaying greater variability in scores. Over the two years, students generally demonstrated improvement in DL while inter-individual differences in DL growth rates widened. These findings indicate the widening of digital divides and highlight the need to investigate factors that contribute to diversity in DL development. In conclusion, our study provides evidence for the robustness of the DLA as an instrument to assess DL growth across ages and over time. Further, the DLA allowed us to uncover the substantial overlap in DL ability across different age groups and the widening second-level digital divide as children move into higher grades, and that the digital divide aggravated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications and challenges to the learning and assessment of DL are discussed.',

    title: 'Boon or Bane? Evaluating AI-driven learning assistance in higher education professional coursework',
    summary: 'AI integration in professional coursework has gained attention in higher education, offering potential improvements in learning and performance. However; the usage rate, accuracy, and patterns of AI tools across disciplines remain unclear. The impact of AI on students’ learning and long-term outcomes still needs further investigation. This study investigates the role of AI-driven learning tools in enhancing professional coursework across various academic disciplines, including Engineering, Natural Sciences, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Arts. Using a multi-stage empirical approach, we evaluate student performance and engagement with AI tools, exploring both the positive outcomes and limitations in each discipline. Our findings show that 1,472 students across different regions and academic fields frequently use AI-driven learning tools in their professional coursework, with generally positive feedback. The accuracy of AI-generated responses to 1,200 questions is commendable, but the tools still demonstrate limitations in areas such as flexibility, contextual adaptation, analytical reasoning, and conceptual synthesis in certain disciplines. We segment 800 representative students based on AI engagement patterns, revealing distinct usage behaviors and preferences across four groups, offering further insights into how AI tools are utilized. Furthermore, the results from assessing the impact of AI-driven learning on the academic performance of 400 students show that AI significantly enhances performance in technical fields like Engineering and Natural Sciences. However, instructors in these fields express concerns about students’ over-reliance on AI, which may hinder independent thinking and creative problem-solving. Despite these concerns, our long-term academic outcome predictions indicate that AI-driven learning tools continue to provide substantial benefits to students.',

    title: 'Exploring Personal Experience and Value Creation in Postdigital Education: Insights from a Large-Scale MOOC Survey',
    summary: 'This study explores how participants of massive open online courses (MOOCs) perceive value creation within online learning environments. Drawing on the value creation framework (VCF), we developed and empirically validated a questionnaire, which was completed by 1227 learners enrolled in MOOCs offered by TU Delft. The aim was to provide deeper insight into participants’ experiences and the perceived impact of MOOCs on their personal and professional development. More specifically, this research explores the immediate, potential, applied, realized, and transformative value creation cycles. Our findings reveal significant insights into the multifaceted impacts of study behavior on learners’ perceptions. Participants reported benefits such as skill acquisition, professional development, and enhanced confidence while highlighting areas needing improvement, such as practical application opportunities and course relevance. This study highlights the importance of aligning MOOC content with learner needs and providing ongoing support to maximize the educational value that online courses can offer. These insights contribute to understanding educational value in the postdigital age, advocating for the development and support of MOOCs to foster continued personal and professional growth.',

    summary: "The current study investigated the contributions of background factors (i.e., gender, age, and parents’ education), learning strategies, behavioural engagement in different domains (i.e., reading, writing, numeracy, and ICT), and cognitive skills (i.e., literacy and numeracy) to problem solving in technology-rich environments among tertiary students across 24 countries. The sample for this study comprised 12,148 tertiary students ( M age  = 25.68 years, 55% female). The results indicated that younger students exhibited better performance in problem solving within technology-rich environments. Furthermore, students whose parents had higher levels of education were more likely to demonstrate higher levels of problem-solving proficiency. Students who employed more effective learning strategies tended to have higher levels of problem-solving abilities. Higher levels of literacy and numeracy performance were associated with better problem-solving performance. Moreover, the study revealed a positive relationship between parents' education at the country level and students' problem-solving performance. This study further explored the similarities and differences in predicting the study variables related to problem solving. The implications of the study's findings were discussed in relation to learning, teaching, and policymaking in higher education. These findings can inform educational practices and policies to enhance problem-solving skills among tertiary students, ultimately improving their preparedness for technology-rich environments.",

    summary: 'Evidence shows higher education (HE) leads to such socio-economic outcomes as better jobs, income, and happiness. While this implies HE demonstrates multifaceted values incorporating economic benefits and non-pecuniary public good, their causal relationship and longitudinal trends remain empirically elusive. Using data from the General Social Survey over 50 years in the USA (1973–2022, N  = 35,483), we conduct causal mediation analysis to examine the effect of college completion on happiness, including indirect pathways through occupational attainment and income. The results reveal that the overall happiness return to HE has increased over 45 years, followed by a nosedive in 2021–2022 during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the mid-1970s, HE contributed to happiness primarily via occupations, whereas the direct HE-happiness linkage conditional on economic rewards showed a negative sign. However, the relative impact of jobs subsided while the mediating role of income net of occupations increased. Meanwhile, the happiness return to postgraduate degrees has been consistently mediated by occupations. Notably, these premiums for HE are formed in tandem with declining happiness levels among less-educated individuals. We thus argue (1) HE may contribute to relatively better non-pecuniary outcomes like subjective well-being, underpinned by enhanced economic benefits, through different mechanisms for undergraduates and postgraduates; (2) this HE effect emerges alongside marginalization of the less educated; and (3) HE policy/practice should consider both potentially positive and adverse effects on college completers and non-completers to fulfill its public good role. Given that macro-socioeconomic conditions may affect these dynamics, we also call for further comparative studies in this field.',

    summary: 'Model United Nations (Model UN) simulations have long been hailed as transformative educational experiences, particularly for students pursuing careers in the fields of law, international affairs, or diplomacy. However, their potential to cultivate a diverse array of skills across wider disciplines, and the importance of these disciplines’ participation within UN forums, has often been overlooked. Here, we argue that Model UNs serve as invaluable entry points for students from various academic backgrounds to engage with pressing global issues, develop critical thinking abilities, enhance communication skills, and foster a sense of global citizenship. This ultimately builds intergovernmental literacy and capacity among the wider population, enabling action by a broader suite of societal actors (beyond diplomacy). By critically examining the multifaceted benefits of Model UN participation, this piece advocates for broader recognition and integration of Model UNs across faculties and disciplines within higher education curricula.',

    title: 'Using Computational Grounded Theory to Analyze Pre-service Chemistry Teachers’ Reflective Practice Regarding Technology Integration in Classrooms Within a Service-Learning–Oriented Seminar',
    summary: 'Integrating digital technologies in science education requires innovative methods to bridge theoretical knowledge and practical classroom application. This study examines a seminar at an Austrian university that was redesigned to address pre-service chemistry teachers’ professional knowledge regarding technology implementation in high school classes via a service-learning approach. By combining questionnaires with formative evaluation through reflective learning diaries, our study captures the multifaceted nature of professional knowledge acquisition. Central to this work is the use of natural language processing within a Computational Grounded Theory framework to analyze students’ reflective diaries. We employed techniques such as word embeddings and topic modeling to extract latent themes and patterns in student texts. We revealed that, despite mixed results from conventional self-report measures and deductive qualitative content analysis, students’ written reflections offered rich insights into their learning processes when we investigated them through the lens of natural language processing. Along the diary entries, our analysis uncovered shifts in emphasis from, e.g., broad cultural perceptions of teaching and learning to more detailed considerations of lesson planning and technology integration. These nuanced insights underscore the complementary value of natural language processing in identifying underlying patterns of reflective practice that traditional assessments may overlook. Although the study is limited by its small sample size and methodological constraints, the findings suggest that incorporating computational techniques can enhance the formative assessment of free writing in teacher education programs. Overall, the results motivate us to advocate for the integration of computational text analysis as a promising tool in evaluating and fostering the complex interplay of professional knowledge and reflective practice in technology-enhanced science education.',

    title: 'Investigating the Impact of Social Determinants of Health on Diagnostic Delays and Access to Antifibrotic Treatment in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.',
    abstract: 'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disease that is challenging to diagnose. Patients with IPF often spend years awaiting a diagnosis after the onset of initial respiratory symptoms, and only a small percentage receive antifibrotic treatment. In this study, we examine the associations between social determinants of health (SDoH) and two critical factors: time to IPF diagnosis following the onset of initial respiratory symptoms, and whether the patient receives antifibrotic treatment. To approximate individual SDoH characteristics, we extract demographic-specific averages from zip code-level data using the American Community Survey (via the U.S. Census Bureau API). Two classification models are constructed, including logistic regression and XGBoost classification. The results indicate that for time-to-diagnosis, the top three SDoH factors are education, gender, and insurance coverage. Patients with higher education levels and better insurance are more likely to receive a quicker diagnosis, with males having an advantage over females. For antifibrotic treatment, the top three SDoH factors are insurance, gender, and race. Patients with better insurance coverage are more likely to receive antifibrotic treatment, with males and White patients having an advantage over females and patients of other ethnicities. This research may help address disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of IPF related to socioeconomic status.',

    title: 'Generative AI Is Not Ready for Clinical Use in Patient Education for Lower Back Pain Patients, Even With Retrieval-Augmented Generation.',
    abstract: 'Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability globally. Following the onset of LBP and subsequent treatment, adequate patient education is crucial for improving functionality and long-term outcomes. Despite advancements in patient education strategies, significant gaps persist in delivering personalized, evidence-based information to patients with LBP. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have demonstrated the potential to enhance patient education. However, their application and efficacy in delivering educational content to patients with LBP remain underexplored and warrant further investigation. In this study, we introduce a novel approach utilizing LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and few-shot learning to generate tailored educational materials for patients with LBP. Physical therapists manually evaluated our model responses for redundancy, accuracy, and completeness using a Likert scale. In addition, the readability of the generated education materials is assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease score. The findings demonstrate that RAG-based LLMs outperform traditional LLMs, providing more accurate, complete, and readable patient education materials with less redundancy. Having said that, our analysis reveals that the generated materials are not yet ready for use in clinical practice. This study underscores the potential of AI-driven models utilizing RAG to improve patient education for LBP; however, significant challenges remain in ensuring the clinical relevance and granularity of content generated by these models.',

    title: 'Student-led experimental evolution reveals novel biofilm regulatory networks underlying adaptations to multiple niches.',
    abstract: 'UNLABELLED: We established a research-education partnership known as EvolvingSTEM that provides secondary school students the opportunity to conduct authentic research experiments centered on microbial evolution. These experiments are currently conducted by thousands of high school students and can offer an unprecedented window into biofilm adaptation while building a community of young researchers. Providing high school students access to research experiences improves learning and can have positive and long-lasting impacts on their attitudes towards science. Moreover, student research can make impactful scientific contributions. Through EvolvingSTEM, students evolve populations of  in a biofilm bead model and observe heritable changes in colony morphology. Genome sequencing of 70 mutants that they picked identified parallel mutations in genes known to regulate biofilm growth (  ,  ,  ). We also uncovered novel adaptations: loss-of-function mutations in phosphodiesterase PFLU0185 that did not alter colony morphology, and mutations affecting periplasmic disulfide bond formation producing small colonies. PFLU0185 mutations consistently reached high frequencies and phenotyping revealed roles in cyclic di-GMP regulation, biofilm formation, and motility, prompting us to name this gene  ( b iofilm and mo tility o ptimizer). Competition experiments and microscopy demonstrated  mutants employ generalist strategies and coexist with the ancestor and specialist mutants through niche differentiation. Consequently, phenotypic diversity is maintained, with smooth (ancestral and  ) colonies consistently outnumbering wrinkly and fuzzy variants. The study advances understanding of biofilm genetic architecture while demonstrating that student-led research can uncover mechanisms of microbial adaptation relevant to  infection biology and provide transformative STEM experiences.\n' +
      'IMPORTANCE: Bacterial biofilms dominate microbial life, yet their evolutionary genetics remain incompletely understood. This science education project engages thousands of high school students in experimental evolution, yielding discoveries about biofilm adaptation while transforming their science education. Selected mutants included PFLU0185/  , a conserved phosphodiesterase that helps bacteria balance the competing demands of attachment and dispersal essential for biofilm life cycle success. The finding that smooth-colony generalists rather than conspicuous variants dominate biofilm adaptation adds to our understanding of the process of niche differentiation in biofilms. This work also demonstrates the power of distributed research networks for discovery of new genetic pathways of adaptation. Students gained authentic research experience, potentially inspiring them to join the next generation of scientists, while identifying mutants adapted to discrete conditions that maintain diversity within biofilms. This synergy between education and discovery offers a scalable model for addressing complex biological questions while developing scientific literacy in diverse classrooms.',

It is well-documented that viral hepatitis is the leading cause of liver cancer and liver failure, with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C being the most common viruses associated with these outcomes.\n' +
      'AIM: To study viral hepatitis-related mortality trends from 1999 to 2022, focusing on gender, race/ethnicity, age, region, and urban/rural classifications.\n' +

    title: 'Strengthening antimicrobial stewardship in public health facilities in Malawi through a participatory epidemiology approach.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In healthcare settings, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is largely driven by excessive use of antibiotics. Empirical prescription largely remains common due to fragile healthcare systems characterized by lack of appropriate diagnostic services. Despite limited data on the epidemiology and the burden of AMR due to the scarcity of routine microbiology facilities, it is evident that Malawi shares a heavy burden of AMR. Effectively implemented antimicrobial stewardship programmes have demonstrated successes in minimizing inappropriate antibiotic usage, and curbing the burden of AMR. However, there are limited data on how antimicrobial stewardship teams can effectively deliver their roles in hospital settings in resource limited settings, including in Malawi.\n' +
      "METHODS: Malawi's Antimicrobial Resistance National Coordinating Centre (AMRCC) in collaboration with Clinical Research Education and Management Services (CREAMS) conducted participatory workshops with hospital-based antimicrobial stewardship committees aimed at establishing drivers of resistance and antibiotic overuse in hospitals from the perspective of the committees, and co-design facility-friendly intervention against AMR. The workshops consisted of participatory discussion, sorting and design thinking exercises, utilizing principles of implementation research. All the interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed, revealing key drivers for antibiotic overuse and resistance in hospital settings. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Key drivers of AMR included limited antibiotic formulary access, poor cross-sectoral coordination challenges between healthcare, veterinary services, government agencies and private facilities, and culturally specific barriers. The participants recommended regular training for healthcare workers on AMR and infection prevention and control (IPC), widespread dissemination of AMR findings, public awareness, introducing electronic monitoring systems and the enforcement of antibiotic restriction policies as the best measures for improving rational antimicrobial use and controlling the spread of AMR.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the complexity of the drivers for antibiotic overuse and resistance in hospital settings, as well as the need for more participatory approaches in tackling the complex challenge of AMR. The findings also signify the importance of a bottom-up approach in designing a solution for promoting antimicrobial stewardship and controlling resistance in hospital and community settings. Participatory approaches blended with principles of implementation research will help to identify contextual challenges, and help to design solutions that are people-centred, context-specific and largely accepted by all involved stakeholders.',

    title: 'Integrating gender medicine into modern healthcare: Progress and barriers.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Sex and gender are fundamental determinants of health, influencing disease risk, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes across medical disciplines. While sex refers to biological characteristics, gender encompasses sociocultural dimensions, including behaviours and identities.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The field of gender medicine has evolved significantly from its roots in the women's health movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which initially sought to address reproductive rights and the systematic exclusion of women from clinical research. Over time, the focus has expanded to recognize sex- and gender-based differences in all populations, including men and gender-diverse individuals. Despite progress, persistent challenges remain. Many clinical guidelines inadequately incorporate sex and gender considerations, and women continue to be underrepresented in clinical trials, resulting in suboptimal efficacy and a higher incidence of adverse effects in women. Recent initiatives, including government-funded research programs, specialized gender medicine professorships and regulatory measures promoting equitable clinical trial participation, represent positive steps forward. However, a systematic, interdisciplinary approach is required to fully integrate gender-sensitive medicine into research, education and clinical practice. This narrative review explores the historical development of gender medicine, current advancements and remaining challenges. We highlight the need for improved research methodologies, policy changes and targeted interventions to ensure equitable healthcare. A structured action plan emphasizing regulatory support, education, industry involvement and public awareness is essential to accelerate the field's integration.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Recognising and addressing sex- and gender-sensitive health differences will lead to more personalised and effective medical care, ultimately improving health outcomes for all individuals.',

    title: 'Long-term fertility trends by birth order in Britain: Comparison between England & Wales and Scotland.',
    abstract: 'This study uses census-linked administrative data to investigate childbearing trends by birth order in Britain over three decades. This is the first study to investigate longer-term changes in fertility dynamics in Britain by birth order and to compare parity-specific fertility by country. First-birth rates declined in the 1990s, slightly increased in the first decade of this century, and decreased thereafter, with changes in timing of parenthood responsible for these changes. Second- and third-birth rates declined in the 1990s but remained relatively stable in the early twenty-first century. Birth intervals remained unchanged, meaning that changes in quantum are responsible for trends in higher-order birth rates. Time trends are similar in England & Wales and Scotland but with significantly lower second- and third-birth rates in Scotland. Changes in population composition by education and ethnicity explain little of the aggregate fertility trends or between-country differences. Both countries have seen rapid declines in first-birth rates, especially among low-educated women.',

    title: 'Lessons learned from approaches in COVID-19 risk Communication and community engagement in Malawi: an exploratory study.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: During public health emergencies like COVID-19, approaches used in Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) are critical in the process of transmitting and exchanging health information. However, there is generally limited literature on COVID-19 RCCE approaches, particularly their strengths and limitations. The current study seeks to contribute to that literature by exploring approaches that were used in COVID-19 RCCE in Malawi, a sub-Saharan African (SSA) country, and drawing lessons from the response based on experiences of those who implemented it.\n' +
      'METHOD: Using in-depth interviews with ten key informants and ten project reports from three organizations, data were analysed thematically in MAXQDA 2022.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Significant themes that emerged revealed COVID-19 RCCE employed use of interpersonal approaches like training, peer education, mHealth and social media; use of community mobilization strategies like engagement meetings and dialogues, loud hearing through mobile vans and whistle stops; behaviour change printed materials; and the mass media. Effectiveness hinged on each method's accessibility, intrinsic qualities, and reach. Implementers also emphasized the value of combining multiple approaches and the challenges posed by COVID-19 restrictions.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: The study underscores the need to select context-appropriate, accessible RCCE approaches to convey critical information, and contributes to the evidence base for future pandemic responses, especially in resource-limited settings.',
