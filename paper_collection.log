    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'The Future of Accounting Education Under the Developments in AI',
    summary: 'The development of science depends on the basics and principles of Science and scientific research in this science or field, and due to the fact that the nature of the science and field of accounting is developing and improving continuously and rapidly associated with many relationships and fields under many variables and factors, and then this research deals with difficulties between the three variables represented in scientific research, accounting education, and AI, specifically under of the widespread reliance on the preparation and preparation of scientific research using many advanced methods of AI, and then increasing the connection between and the development provided by scientific research. Accounting science and what is repeated in different formats follow the methods of AI. The research also aims to clarify the relationship between AI, accounting education, and accounting scientific research by conducting a questionnaire on a sample of 84 university professors and researchers in the field of accounting. The statistical analysis of the data collected by applying SPSS 25. It was concluded that the relationship between the three variables is considered close and interconnected. Without the first (accounting education), the development of the second (accounting scientific research) stops, which is considered inappropriate for the current business environment in all its categories, whether teaching or learning. Both scientific research and accounting education depend on the latter (AI) to provide technical and analytical support and classify opinions to reduce repetition and avoid deficiencies in the feasibility of research in accounting education.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Peer coaching in a rural setting: A feasibility study.',
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Peer coaching has gained traction as a method for enhancing practical and personal skills without the hierarchical dynamic sometimes found in mentorship. It creates a collaborative environment, encourages inclusivity and community building, and supports skill development across various disciplines and levels of experience. The objective of our study was to assess the feasibility, satisfaction, and effects of a reciprocal peer coaching pilot program for practising physicians in Northern Ontario's remote and rural regions.\n" +
      "METHODS: Participants completed 'Peer coaching in practice' micromodules from The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and attended an in-person demonstration. Each participant committed to 2 sessions as both coach and coachee with a self-selected partner. Feedback was gathered at each study interval.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Our qualitative study found that peer coaching positively impacted physicians' daily habits, wellness, and professional growth. The study emphasised the importance of cohesive partnerships in peer coaching and highlighted substantial benefits for both coaches and coachees. The feasibility of peer coaching was a key finding, demonstrating its potential to build supportive communities, particularly for providers in remote areas. While in-person interaction was preferred, the study also acknowledged the potential of virtual coaching, which could benefit providers isolated by geography, demographics, or practice modality.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Peer coaching is an alternative, novel form of continuing medical education and knowledge exchange. It is particularly relevant in rural communities offering crucial support to local providers, especially those in rural or isolated areas where access to formal continued medical education is limited. Our results suggest that peer coaching can significantly improve the daily practices and overall well-being of physicians.\n' +
      "INTRODUCTION: Le coaching entre pairs s'est imposé comme une méthode permettant d'améliorer les compétences pratiques et personnelles sans la dynamique hiérarchique que l'on retrouve parfois dans le mentorat. Il crée un environnement collaboratif, favorise l'inclusion et le développement communautaire, tout en soutenant le développement des compétences dans diverses disciplines et à différents niveaux d'expérience. L'objectif de cette étude était d'évaluer la faisabilité, la satisfaction et les effets d'un programme pilote de coaching réciproque entre pairs destiné aux médecins en exercice dans les régions rurales et isolées du nord de l'Ontario.\n" +
      `MTHODES: Les participants ont suivi les micromodules " Expérience Coaching entre pairs " du Collège royal des médecins et chirurgiens du Canada et ont assisté à une démonstration en personne. Chaque participant s'est engagé à participer à deux séances en tant que coach et aidé (e) avec un partenaire de son choix. Des commentaires ont été recueillis à chaque intervalle de l'étude.\n` +
      "RSULTATS: Notre étude qualitative a révélé que le coaching entre pairs avait un impact positif sur les habitudes quotidiennes, le bien-être et le développement professionnel des médecins. Elle a souligné l'importance de partenariats solides dans le cadre du coaching entre pairs et a mis en évidence des avantages substantiels tant pour les coachs que pour les aidés. La faisabilité du coaching entre pairs a été une conclusion clé, démontrant son potentiel pour créer des communautés solidaires, en particulier pour les prestataires de soins dans les zones isolées. Bien que les interactions en personne aient été préférées, l'étude a également reconnu le potentiel du coaching virtuel qui pourrait bénéficier aux prestataires isolés par la géographie, la démographie ou leur mode d'exercice.\n" +
      "CONCLUSION: Le coaching entre pairs est une forme alternative et novatrice de formation médicale continue et d'échange de connaissances. Il est particulièrement pertinent dans les communautés rurales où il offre un soutien crucial aux prestataires locaux, en particulier ceux des zones rurales ou isolées où l'accès à une formation médicale continue formelle est limité. Nos résultats suggèrent que le coaching entre pairs peut améliorer considérablement les pratiques quotidiennes et le bien-être général des médecins.",

    title: 'Promoting a Multidisciplinary Team for Early Mobilisation in Mechanically Ventilated Patients: An Innovation in Health Professional Education-A Quasi-Experimental Pre-Post Study.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Early mobilisation (EM) in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients is a safe and feasible, evidence-based practice with positive health outcomes. It decreases intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness and delirium, hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, readmissions and billings, morbidity and mortality. It improves the physical and mental health of critically ill patients. Healthcare professionals' education and readiness are key in establishing EM for practice. Although it is practised in many high-income countries, it has not yet been introduced as a standard care approach in ICUs of Pakistan, a low/middle-income country.\n" +
      'AIM: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of healthcare professionals regarding EM of MV patients at an adult ICU through electronic learning (E-learning).\n' +
      "STUDY DESIGN: A quasi-experimental pre/posttest design was employed on a sample of 57 multidisciplinary healthcare professionals. The study was conducted in the medical and surgical adult ICU of a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. A total population sampling strategy was deployed. A questionnaire was administered to assess the knowledge and attitude of healthcare professionals regarding the EM of MV patients. After expert review and pilot testing, the study questionnaire was contextually modified. A self-developed E-learning module inspired by Kirkpatrick's framework was utilised as an intervention. The duration of the intervention was 120 min, with the participants completing the module at their convenience. Paired t-test and descriptive statistics from the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21 were used to analyse the results. Knowledge and attitude scores were evaluated.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Demographic data revealed that the majority of participants were critical care registered nurses (71.9%), having 3-4 years of ICU work experience (38.6%) and working in a surgical ICU (54.4%). Only a few participants received EM training (19.3%). The majority of participants' level of education was Undergraduate Nursing (61.4%), with an average age of 29 years, and female gender (56.1%). A statistically significant change (p value < 0.01) in overall knowledge was identified, specifically for items related to the impact of EM in reducing delirium (p value = 0.01), improving patients' awareness (p value = 0.007), requiring less sedation (p value < 0.01), initiating on patients that can respond to verbal commands (p value = 0.03), promoting feasible (p value = 0.001) and safe practice (p value = 0.004), and requiring a multidisciplinary team approach (p value = 0.03). However, overall attitude (p value = 0.096) was unchanged with E-learning.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: The study reflected an increase in knowledge among healthcare professionals. E-learning was seen to be a useful strategy for knowledge improvement. EM in MV patients was a new concept for the participants. Participants became aware of the benefits of the EM process and acknowledged the role of multidisciplinary collaboration. There is evidence to upscale the study to test the intervention and expand to other tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan to attain generalisability of results.\n' +
      'RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The study has assessed and generated knowledge among healthcare professionals, predominantly critical care nurses, and has baseline data for devising institutional policies and protocols, educational interventions and research avenues for EM implementation. It also gave an optimistic approach to using a combination of E-learning and high-fidelity simulation for capacity building. Implementing EM in MV patients is crucial for critical care nurses, promoting proactive and preventive nursing care that improves patient outcomes and reduces immobility-related complications. It would also increase multidisciplinary collaboration while enhancing nursing empowerment and professional satisfaction.',

    title: 'Risk Factors and Outcomes of Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections in the Intensive Care Unit of a Tertiary University Hospital: A Prospective Study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are common among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). ICU-related CAUTI is associated with longer hospital stays, greater financial burden, greater antibiotic use and impact on mortality.\n' +
      'AIM: This study aimed to address the incidence and risk factors, causative pathogens and outcomes of CAUTI among patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary University Hospital.\n' +
      'STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective study. All adult patients admitted to the ICU of a University Hospital who had indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs) at admission were included. Based on the occurrence of CAUTI, the study cohorts were divided into two groups: those with CAUTI and those without CAUTI. The incidence, risk factors, causative pathogens and the outcomes of patients with CAUTI were addressed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: One hundred and forty patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 43.84 ± 13.86 years, and 69/140 (49.3%) were male. The incidence of CAUTI was 43.5. CAUTI were significantly related to older age, female sex, smoking, post-surgery, diabetes mellitus (DM), obstructive uropathy, immobility, faecal incontinence and the duration of urinary catheterisation. Cox regression analysis revealed that the most significant risk factors for CAUTI were the duration of urinary catheterisation, DM and post-surgery, with hazard ratio of 7.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.78-14.63, p < 0.001, 6.25, 95% CI 3.13-11.47, p < 0.001 and 2.34, 95% CI 1.23-4.45, p = 0.010, respectively.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that the incidence of CAUTI among ICU patients is high. Numerous risk factors for CAUTI were identified and included older age, female sex, longer duration of catheterisation, smoking, post-surgery, DM, obstructive uropathy and immobility. The most significant risk factors for CAUTI were the duration of urinary catheterisation, DM and post-surgery. Special precautions are needed to prevent CAUTI among ICU patients with those risk factors.\n' +
      'RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The results of this study will have implications for daily ICU practice. It is important to identify high-risk patients and consider targeted preventive measures. Ongoing education for healthcare workers on CAUTI prevention and management should be taken into account.',

    title: 'Nutrition Education Interventions for the d/Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing: A Systematic Scoping Review.',
    abstract: 'The d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) population, of all ages, is at increased risk for poor dietary habits that may lead to health complications, given the lack of accessible and inclusive nutrition education from a range of providers. Given these challenges and the urgent need for inclusive health education, this systematic scoping review critically assessed the nature, scope, effectiveness, and best practices of nutrition-focused interventions tailored for the general DHH population. Using the PICOS search method of 16 bibliographic databases for articles between 2000 and 2024 focusing on nutrition-related interventions tailored to the DHH population, eight studies were identified. Studies employed various intervention approaches, focus areas of nutrition, location, and participants. One study used a theoretical framework. Most interventions addressed multiple aspects of dietary behavior, while others focused on specific concerns such as healthy food choices and exercise. Interventions were delivered through in-person educational sessions by public health professionals and nutritionists. Only one of the eight studies reviewed did not report statistically significant improvements in dietary behavior or health outcomes following the intervention. Future research should integrate established behavior change theories to strengthen the design, implementation, and longer-term follow-up and evaluation of nutrition interventions for DHH populations. There is a surprising lack of research in this area, exacerbated by additional challenges in reaching the DHH population. Improving nutrition education for DHH individuals requires interventions that address communication barriers, cultural inclusivity, and accessibility by all types of providers, and reaching such groups in a range of places.',

    title: 'Early Mobility for Post-Cardiac Surgery Patients on Vasoactive Medication: A Nurse-Led Quality Improvement Project.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Early mobilisation (EM) is critical for faster recovery in critically ill patients; it leads to improved outcomes, such as reduced length of stay (LOS), decreased muscle atrophy and minimal functional decline. However, implementing EM in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU), particularly for patients on vasopressors, poses challenges due to concerns regarding haemodynamic instability and adverse events. Success depends on nurses' knowledge and confidence; however, barriers exist in high-acuity settings.\n" +
      'AIM: This study aimed to enhance the knowledge and perspectives of CVICU nurses regarding EM among patients receiving vasopressors and to assess its impact on patient outcomes.\n' +
      'STUDY DESIGN: A quality improvement initiative was conducted in the adult CVICU of a tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. An educational programme was delivered to CVICU nurses to improve their understanding and use of the Banner Mobility Assessment Tool in daily practice, forming the basis for implementing EM protocols.\n' +
      "RESULTS: A total of 40 nurses received education, of which 25 (62.5%) responded to the questionnaire before implementation and 30 (75%) responded afterwards. The intervention significantly improved the nurses' knowledge of ICU-acquired weakness in patients receiving vasopressors (p = 0.005). Confidence in initiating EM (p = 0.002), starting without a physician's request (p = 0.006) and staying updated on mobility practices (p = 0.001) also increased. The pre-implementation group had 27 patients, while the post-implementation group had 45 patients; 24 in the EM group and 21 in the late mobilisation group. ICU mobility scores significantly increased between pre- and post-implementation groups (p < 0.001). The mean ICU mobility score at CVICU discharge was higher in the EM group (8.9 ± 0.9) than in the pre-implementation group (7.8 ± 0.6) (p < 0.001).\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Nurse-driven early mobility for post-cardiac surgery patients taking vasoactive medication is safe and feasible and facilitates improved patient mobility before discharge while reducing the LOS.\n' +

    title: 'Telehealth use in home health care in the US: A literature review.',
    abstract: 'ObjectiveThe rapid shift toward home- and community-based care in the US has intensified the demand for home health care, particularly as the population continues to age. Amid challenges such as workforce shortages and increasing patient needs, telehealth has emerged as a potential strategy to enhance care delivery and patient outcomes in home health settings. This literature review examines empirical studies published between January 2020 and April 2024 to investigate the status of telehealth use within the US in home health care settings.MethodsA systematic search was conducted in PubMed and CINAHL for peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2020 and April 2024. Quality of reviewed studies was assessed independently by reviewers using quality assessment checklists.ResultsSix quasi-experimental studies were included, examining various telehealth modalities in home health care. Tele-video, tele-calls, and remote monitoring were commonly used for patient education, symptom management, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Telehealth interventions were generally associated with high patient satisfaction, reduced acute care utilization, and improved communication between providers and caregivers. Study quality varied, with limitations in sample size, methodology, and outcome measurement affecting generalizability. Further research is needed to optimize telehealth integration in home health care.ConclusionsThese findings highlight the effectiveness of telehealth in delivering home health care and its potential to address current challenges. These findings also call for policy changes for expanded reimbursement models as well as large-scale pragmatic studies to enhance telehealth integration in home health care to support aging in place.',

Focusing on decision-making, mobility, and awareness, it highlights significant regional disparities and explores the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and disempowerment. While overall disempowerment declined over time, women facing IPV, especially in central and eastern regions, remain disproportionately affected. The findings emphasize that regional context and IPV are critical factors influencing empowerment. Efforts focused solely on education and employment may fall short unless IPV is addressed, underscoring the need for region-sensitive, violence-informed policy interventions.",

    title: 'Determining associations between prenatal maternal mental health and social determinants of health with outcomes in children with critical CHD.',
    abstract: "Prenatal maternal mental health and social determinants of health may influence pregnancy, child hospitalisation, and child neurodevelopmental outcomes in critical congential heart disease (CHD). We examined 189 mother-child dyads of children born with CHD who underwent neonatal cardiac surgery and completed neurodevelopmental assessment between the ages 13 and 29 months. We used latent profile analysis to identify distinct maternal groups based on prenatal maternal mental health screening scores and individual- and neighbourhood-level social determinants of health factors. We examined the association between maternal groups with their child's gestational age, birth weight, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and neurodevelopment. Latent profile analysis identified two distinct groups: high-risk ( = 46) and low-risk ( = 143). Mothers in the high-risk group had higher mental health screening scores, lower age, higher social vulnerability, lower education, and were more likely to have Medicaid insurance and represent a minority group than mothers in the low-risk group. The high-risk group had children with lower gestational age and weight at birth, longer HLOS, and lower cognitive, language, and motor scales than children in the low-risk group ( < 0.05). Sensitivity analysis in mother-infant dyads without foetal extracardiac conditions found that significant relationships persisted in the high-risk group, with lower gestational age and lower language scale scores than the low-risk group  < 0.05). Children of mothers with adverse prenatal maternal mental health and social determinants of health risks had significantly worse pregnancy and child outcomes. Interventions are critically needed to address maternal mental health and social determinants of health risks beginning in the prenatal period.",

    abstract: "The death of two-year-old Awaab Ishak in 2020 because of prolonged exposure to mould in his family's social housing flat in Rochdale, England, resulted in Awaab's Law, which mandates timely housing repairs by social housing providers from October 2025. This article explores a collaborative initiative between Frimley Health and Care Integrated Care System and Slough Borough Council to improve the respiratory health of children and young people by addressing the effect of suboptimal housing conditions, particularly damp and mould. Geospatial data and shared records helped to identify high-risk households, ensuring efficient, equitable outreach. The project integrated healthcare and housing services through community-based clinics, roadshows and family hubs, providing targeted asthma interventions, personalised education and environmental remediation. The initiative resulted in improved asthma control for many children and young people, and it highlighted the crucial role of children's nurses in delivering interdisciplinary care, advocating for systemic change and supporting vulnerable families. This model presents a promising approach to reducing health inequalities through integrated, community-led healthcare and housing support.",
