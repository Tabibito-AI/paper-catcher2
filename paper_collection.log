    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    summary: 'Traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, being static and highly abstract, often hinder comprehension, particularly for novice designers and students. This can lead to misinterpretations and process inefficiencies. In this study, we investigate whether immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments can enhance the understanding of BPMN models. We developed a virtual reality (VR)-based BPMN visualization tool and conducted a quasi -experiment with 48 academic and professional participants, who interacted with a 3D BPMN model using Google Cardboard and a joystick. Participants completed comprehension tasks before and after the VR experience. The results show significant improvements in understanding and engagement, suggesting that immersive virtual reality can be a valuable educational tool for BPMN learning. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the integration of 3D environments in process modeling education, offering benefits for both academic and professional training.',

    title: 'Assessing the role of artificial intelligence in quality of legal education with special reference to sustainable development goal',
    summary: 'The transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly apparent in a variety of fields, including legal education. This study investigates the potential of AI in transforming legal education in order to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), 2030. As nations and cultures global struggle to achieve the SDGs, legal professionals play an important role in establishing legal frameworks that support progress toward these goals. It can improve the delivery of legal curricula by providing customized learning experiences targeted to individuals. AI can also help educators to create current content and enhance the evaluation. Education is now more dynamic, accessible, and affordable, expanding its reach. Quality of legal education is a cornerstone of achieving the SDGs set for 2030. The effective utilization of AI in the field of legal education holds significant promise in not only expanding access but also improving the quality of legal education. AI-powered legal research tools have the potential to revolutionize legal research for law students, researchers, and legal practitioners. They can provide more efficient and comprehensive ways to explore legal precedents, case law, and statutes, thus empowering legal professionals to perform their duties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By improving access to legal information, these tools can play a significant role in the formulation of laws and regulations that align with the SDGs. This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which AI can contribute to advancing legal education and, consequently, supporting the attainment of the SDGs.',

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. These instructional strategies aim to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a tool that can promote substantive student involvement and meaningful learning. (An initial draft of this abstract was produced by ChatGPT 4.0, but GenAI was not used in any other way for this article, other than as an interactive partner within the excerpts as clearly marked.)',

    title: 'Making Tens with Four Hands: Touchscreen-Based Classroom Activity for Early Number Learning',
    summary: 'As schools increasingly embrace embodied learning, there is a growing need to incorporate classroom teaching and learning activities that recognize the body’s role as both an individual and collective resource for cognition and instruction. In response, we present a design for a classroom teaching sequence focused on early number learning, featuring pedagogical activities supported by TouchCounts (TC) and engaged by pairs of children using their four hands. These activities showcase the potential of embodied learning for children to explore concepts such as odd and even numbers, as well as the composition and decomposition of numbers up to and including ten. We elaborate on the functionalities of TC, outline the teaching sequence, and offer episodes of our classroom observations. Specifically, we present three lesson snapshots aimed at first-graders (aged 6 to 7) using a class set of TC, student learning outcomes, and notable observations as students interact with the touchscreen environment. For example, we note that the student pairs used their hands to reinforce, extend, and redirect mathematical ideas; besides, they developed a collective discourse through (gestural) subitizing the number of fingers that they (and their partner) put up (and folded down). This snapshot explicates the collective learning experiences in classroom settings involving pair-work activities and informs existing work on embodied (mathematical) cognition beyond how students learn with their bodies individually.',

Using the Artifact Centric Activity Theory framework, we initially analyse the internalisation and externalisation processes that appear to occur during one child’s use of the app. Based on the learning from this process, we then use other aspects of the framework, in particular the subject-artifact-group triangle, to understand how Fingu might be used productively in mathematics education classrooms. Using a 13-min video of a child playing Fingu as our data source, we analyse how children might, as they learn about part-whole relationships, interact with the game. We also investigate how design principles in creating apps can impact on the experience of using the app in ways that may be unintended by their designers. This work has implications for app designers and for mathematics educators seeking to incorporate digital technologies into mathematics education.',

    title: 'A mixed methods evaluation of an online climate change and health certificate program for working professionals',
    summary: 'Background Climate change is one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century, and a diverse cadre of professionals are increasingly pursuing opportunities to learn about this issue. Our goal was to evaluate an online climate change and health (CCH) certificate program for working professionals as a case study. Methods We utilized structured and free-text elements from course and overall program evaluations across seven cohorts of participants from 2018 to 2022 for a mixed-methods assessment of the program. Results A total of 579 enrollees’ data were analyzed. The program completion rate was 90.0% and participants were diverse in their professional and geographic representation, but disproportionately from North America (82.4%). The program was rated favorably; i.e., 98.6% of participants would recommend the program to others. Qualitative analysis identified themes that were grouped as program strengths and opportunities for improvement. Strengths included (1) valuable curriculum, (2) peer-to-peer learning, and (3) a call to action. Opportunities for improvement included: (1) irrelevant course content, (2) challenges with course structure, and (3) insufficient opportunities for networking. Conclusions The evaluations demonstrate the overall importance of educational offerings in CCH. Our case study demonstrated that working professionals in public health, allied health professions, and non-health professions express desire, benefit, and appreciation for educational opportunities on this important intersection. They especially valued strong, relevant course content, professional networking and peer-to-peer learning, and acquisition of effective skills for use in their work. We have used lessons learned from this case study to improve our program and encourage others to use them to improve their programs or to develop new ones. A workforce that is highly educated on CCH issues is essential to confront the existential public health challenge of climate change.',

    summary: 'This study examines the acceptance, behaviors and perceptions of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) technologies among pre-service teachers, including the role of Big Five personality traits in shaping attitudes and behaviors. Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected from 476 teacher candidates via the Generative AI Acceptance Scale, the Ten-Item Big Five Personality Inventory, questionnaire and focus group interviews. Results indicate a moderate acceptance of Gen-AI, with significant differences observed between personalities: future teachers characterized by more agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience exhibited higher Gen-AI acceptance across all sub-dimensions. While text-generation tools were widely used for academic purposes, creative applications remained rare. Participants expressed mixed emotions—ranging from enhanced productivity and empowerment to concerns about over-dependency and reduced critical thinking skills. These findings reveal critical gaps in Gen-AI literacy and underscore the necessity for targeted professional development programs emphasizing ethical and effective use. The study offers actionable strategies for educators and policymakers to harness the transformative potential of Gen-AI while mitigating risks, thereby preparing future teachers to integrate Gen-AI responsibly and innovatively into their pedagogical practices.',

    title: 'The impact of online teaching curricula on undergraduate basic surgical skills acquisition.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Despite the growing use of online teaching in medical education, undergraduate surgical skills training remains predominantly face-to-face, with limited structured curricula and resources. Consequently, many students lack confidence performing basic procedures independently. While online programmes offer a potential alternative, comparative evidence is limited. This service evaluation assessed the effectiveness of online surgical skills teaching on student skill acquisition and confidence.\n' +
      'METHODS: Medical students who participated in five UK national surgical skills programmes between 2022 and 2024 were selected, having received either online or face-to-face instruction. Skill acquisition was measured using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) tool and confidence was measured pre- and post-training via a Likert scale. Non-parametric data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney  test, with significance set at  < 0.05.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of 133 participants, 82 received online and 51 face-to-face training. Fifty-six percent were in their first or second year of study. No significant differences were found in continuous ( = 0.0652) or mattress suturing ( = 0.143), while interrupted suturing scores were significantly higher in the online group ( = 0.0143). Both modalities significantly improved confidence ( < 0.0001), with no significant difference between groups ( > 0.05).\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that online surgical skills teaching is as effective as face-to-face methods, with both positively impacting skill acquisition and confidence. A hybrid approach, integrating online and face-to-face teaching, could optimise learning by combining the scalability of online instruction with essential practical experience, enhancing medical students' confidence and technical proficiency in surgical skills.",

    title: 'Using Social Media to Combat Influenza Vaccine Misinformation and Improve Uptake: A Social Media Campaign and Repeated Cross-sectional Survey Analysis.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To combat influenza (flu)-vaccine misinformation and improve vaccine uptake using social media.\n' +
      'PATIENTS AND METHODS: Unbiased Science used an online survey to identify flu vaccine-hesitant demographic groups and their specific objections to vaccination. Targeted educational content was then created and deployed through a variety of media formats, including podcasts, newsletters, reels, and infographics. A postcampaign survey determined the proportion of individuals who changed their minds about vaccination as a result of the educational content. The study was conducted between October 28, 2022 and February 7, 2023.\n' +
      'RESULTS: In 3626 precampaign surveys, 187 individuals (5.1%) reported being unvaccinated and not planning to get the flu vaccine (the unvaccinated group). Multivariable analysis showed that geographic region (Northeast and Southeast), gender identity (male and other), race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic other), and education level (high-school or less and some college) were independently associated with being unvaccinated. The main reasons were needlephobia, dismissal of flu severity, and concerns about vaccine components, multiple vaccines, and side effects. In 838 postcampaign surveys, 39 individuals (4.7%) indicated changing their mind about vaccination: of these, 27 (69.2%) said they were more likely to get vaccinated and 22 (56.4%) had gotten vaccinated. Twenty individuals (51.3%) said they changed their mind at least in part because of the targeted educational content.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Social media has the potential to change attitudes and behaviors around vaccination. When science messaging is deployed across several platforms and targeted to key demographic characteristics, it has the ability to combat misinformation and influence vaccine uptake.',

    title: 'Bridging the Gaps in Sexual Health: Gender, Age, and Educational Disparities Among Albanian University Students.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Understanding sexual health inequalities among university students is essential to inform targeted public health interventions. Previous studies show that knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors differ based on sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, and level of education.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess how gender, age, and SRH education influence knowledge, behaviors, and use of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services among Albanian university students.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 7,679 university students in public and private institutions across Albania. A structured questionnaire assessed SRH knowledge, STI prevention behaviors, and access to healthcare services. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and logistic regression to examine relationships between sociodemographic variables and SRH outcomes.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Female students reported higher engagement in preventive practices such as gynecological visits and Pap tests (p < 0.001), while male students reported earlier sexual debut and less consistent condom use. Prior SRH education significantly increased the likelihood of STI/HIV testing (p < 0.001). Age was positively associated with STI awareness but not necessarily with service use. Only 11.4% of respondents reported STI testing, and 7.6% had been tested for HIV, while 53.8% were unaware of available testing services.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This study highlights disparities in SRH knowledge and service utilization driven by gender, age, and educational exposure. Tailored public health programs that integrate SRH into university curricula and emphasize outreach to young men and underserved populations are needed to reduce inequities and promote preventive behaviors.',

      'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the experiences of hemodialysis patients at Hanoi Nephrology Hospital in 2023 and identify several factors related to patient experience.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2023 among 401 patients at the Hemodialysis department of the Hanoi Nephrology Hospital. The study utilized a structured questionnaire titled "In-Center Hemodialysis Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (ICH CAHPS)" to conduct face-to-face interviews with the selected patients. Logistic regression analysis was applied to identify several factors associated with patient experiences.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Overall, patients reported positive experiences, particularly in their interactions with nephrologists. The highest satisfaction (78%) was for updates on treatment information from other doctors. Positive experiences were more likely to be reported by patients aged 55-64 years (versus. ≥75 years), having health insurance or other insurance (versus. No insurance), and having middle education (versus. Lower education). Living 15-30 km from a dialysis center and being a business traders increased satisfaction.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: This study emphasized the necessity of improving communication and patient education in hemodialysis care, specifically concerning treatment options. It recommended targeted interventions and additional research to enhance the patient experience and the quality of care in Vietnam's hemodialysis centers.",

    title: "Epidemiology of hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks before and during availability of EV-A71 vaccine in China's mainland: analysis of outbreak surveillance data from 2011 to 2023.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common contagious illness of childhood that causes a heavy disease burden in China's mainland. There are three enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) vaccines licensed and used in China since 2016. Our study describes changes in epidemiological characteristics of HFMD outbreaks following EV-A71 vaccine introduction.\n" +
      "METHODS: Using HFMD outbreak data notified to China CDC during 2011-2023, we compared characteristics of HFMD outbreaks before and after EV-A71 vaccine licensure and availability. We determined risk factors associated with outbreak size with a multivariate regression model and explored county-level patterns of outbreak clusters using local indicators of spatial association (Anselin Local Moran's ).\n" +
      'FINDINGS: During 2011-2023, there were 2838 HFMD outbreaks reported with more than ten cases each that were included in our study. There were 53,958 HFMD cases and 17 deaths in the included outbreaks. The median attack rate was 0.07% (IQR = 0.04%-0.13%) and the median outbreak duration was 14 days (IQR = 9-21). Outbreaks began before school seasons started and peaked during weeks 16-25; most (87.95%) occurred in kindergartens, followed by primary or secondary schools (6.69%). Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) caused 54.94% of the HFMD outbreaks, EV-A71 caused 19.77%, CV-A6 caused 8.99%, CV-A10 caused 0.53%, and other enteroviruses caused 15.76%. After EV-A71 vaccine was introduced into the market as a non-National Immunization Program (NIP) vaccine, the proportion of outbreaks caused by EV-A71 declined to 2.93% in the southern provinces and 4.84% in the northern provinces, and CV-A16, CV-A6, CV-A10, and other enteroviruses increased in proportion. Before EV-A71 vaccine availability, high-high clusters occurred in 37 counties of nine provinces, expanding to 117 counties of nine provinces after vaccine introduction, mainly into southern provinces.\n' +
      'INTERPRETATION: After EV-A71 vaccine was introduced to the market in China, fewer HFMD outbreaks were caused by EV-A71 and more were caused by CV-A16, CV-A6, and CV-A10. The changes of spectrum for HFMD and expansion of outbreaks hotspots associated with vaccine introduction calls for multi-enterovirus vaccine development for controlling HFMD outbreaks.\n' +

    title: 'Exploring the association of vitamin B12 deficiency and dental health in older adults.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in overall health, yet its impact on dental health, particularly dental caries, remains underexplored. Older adults are at an increased risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and dental disease, but the relationship between these two factors is not well understood. This study examines the association between serum vitamin B12 levels and dental health in older adults using data from the NHANES 2011-2014 cycles.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using NHANES data from 1,907 participants aged 65 and older. Serum vitamin B12 levels were categorized as normal (>221 pmol/L), marginal (148-221 pmol/L), and deficient (<148 pmol/L). Dental status was assessed using the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT) index based on NHANES dental health examinations. Poisson regression models evaluated associations between vitamin B12 levels and DMFT scores, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and income.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Lower vitamin B12 levels were significantly associated with higher DMFT scores ( < 0.05). Participants with marginal and deficient vitamin B12 levels exhibited increased DMFT scores compared to those with normal vitamin B12 levels, and these differences persisted after adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors. The findings suggest that inadequate vitamin B12 status may contribute to a greater cumulative burden of dental disease in older adults.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that vitamin B12 deficiency may contribute to a greater lifetime burden of dental disease in older adults. Further research is needed to explore causal mechanisms and assess whether vitamin B12 supplementation could be a preventive measure for maintaining dental health in aging populations.',

    title: 'Patient-reported symptoms in the detection of head and neck cancer recurrence: a systematic review.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Patient-initiated follow-up (PIFU) after treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC) relies on the signs and symptoms of recurrence being detectable by patients. We examine the evidence for patient-reported symptoms as an indicator of recurrence.\n' +
      'METHODS: A search was conducted via OvidMEDLINE and Embase (2010 to January 2024) plus sources of grey literature for studies which describe patient-reported symptoms and recurrent disease. Findings are reported as per PRISMA guidelines.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Twenty studies were included which were highly heterogenous. The median sensitivity of patient-reported symptoms to detect recurrence is 47.3%. Median specificity, positive-predictive value (PPV) and negative-predictive value (NPV) were 79.3%, 9.3% and 98.0% respectively. New symptoms were generally reported at routine follow-up rather than expedited appointments.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The high specificity and NPV of patient-reported symptoms means recurrence is unlikely in the absence of symptoms. Patient education and collection of prospective data through digital health technologies may increase the effectiveness of PIFU.',

    title: 'The practice of advance care planning among ambulatory cancer patients at a tertiary hospital in Kenya: descriptive cross-sectional survey.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) is relevant in the care of cancer patients. Insight into the current practice of ACP can identify high-priority areas to direct interventions aimed at improving the process.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: To assess the practice of ACP among ambulatory cancer patients at a Kenyan hospital.\n' +
      'METHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted at the ambulatory oncology clinic at a tertiary referral hospital. We recruited 387 study participants through consecutive sampling among heterogenous cancer patients. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data, which was analysed by SPSS version 25 and through multivariable logistical regression.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among 387 participants, 78.55% were females. The uptake of advance directives was low; only 27.13% of participants had appointed surrogate decision makers, while 1.5% had living wills. Few had discussed end-of-life wishes with family (28.68%) and doctors (19.63%). Only 27.39% had discussed life expectancy with a doctor. Among those who had not participated in ACP, most were willing to discuss life expectancy (71.9%); discuss end-of-life wishes with family (81.2%) and doctors (85.1%); complete advance directives (68%) and appoint surrogate decision makers (75.9%) in the next 1 month. Doctors were most preferred to initiate ACP discussions. Factors that positively correlated with uptake of advanced directives (ADs) included - ECOG status, discussion with family and with doctors.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The uptake of ADs among ambulatory cancer patients was low; additionally, self-reported participation in ACP was low. Our study highlights the need for widespread education initiatives and standardisation of the ACP process.\n' +
      'RECOMMENDATIONS: There is a need for further studies and strategies to improve the participation in ACP and hence the quality of life among patients with malignancies in Kenya.',
