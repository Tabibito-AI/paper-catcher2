    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +
      'national income model, government-purchases multiplier and tax multiplier.',

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +
      'propensity for educational attainment have been constructed. It is by now well\n' +
      'established that this PGS predicts wages, income, and occupational prestige and\n' +
      'occupational mobility across generations. It is unknown whether a PGS for\n' +
      'educational attainment can predict upward income and occupational mobility even\n' +
      'within the peak earning years of an individual. Using data from the Wisconsin\n' +
      'Longitudinal Study (WLS), I show that: (i) a PGS for educational attainment\n' +
      'predicts wage, income and occupational prestige mobility between 1974 (when\n' +
      'respondents were about 36 years of age) and 1992 (when respondents were about\n' +
      '53 years of age), conditional on 1974 values of these variables and a range of\n' +
      'covariates; (ii) the effect is not mediated by parental socioeconomic status,\n' +
      'is driven primarily by respondents with only a high school education, and is\n' +
      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +
      'our understanding of longitudinal inequality and shed light on the sources of\n' +
      'heterogeneity in responses to economic shocks and policy.',

    summary: 'We consider the use of Quantifier Elimination (QE) technology for automated\n' +
      "reasoning in economics. QE dates back to Tarski's work in the 1940s with\n" +
      'software to perform it dating to the 1970s. There is a great body of work\n' +
      'considering its application in science and engineering but we show here how it\n' +
      'can also find application in the social sciences. We explain how many suggested\n' +
      'theorems in economics could either be proven, or even have their hypotheses\n' +
      'shown to be inconsistent, automatically; and describe the application of this\n' +
      'in both economics education and research. We describe a bank of QE examples\n' +
      'gathered from economics literature and note the structure of these are, on\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +
      'education. In this paper, we show that the predictive power of this proxy\n' +
      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +
      'propose a metric of human capital that is less sensitive than average years of\n' +
      'education and remains as a significant predictor of economic growth when tested\n' +
      'with both cross-section data and panel data. We argue that future research on\n' +
      'economic growth will discard educational variables based on quantity as\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +
      'problem by introducing the demand for unpaid spare time and a user quantity\n' +
      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +
      'knowledge embodied with parts of the supply by education and construction.\n' +
      'Linear amplification yields S-functions as only analytic solutions.\n' +
      'Destructible physical capital controls medium-term recoveries from disaster.\n' +
      'Indestructible human capacity controls the collective long-term industrial\n' +
      'evolution. It is immune even to world wars and runs from 1800 to date parallel\n' +
      'to the unisex life expectancy in the pioneering nations. This is the first\n' +
      'quantitative information on long-term demand. The theory is self-consistent. It\n' +
      'reproduces all peaceful data from 1800 to date without adjustable parameter. It\n' +
      'has full forecasting power since the decisive parameters are constants of the\n' +
      'human species. They predict an asymptotic maximum for the economic level per\n' +

    title: 'Applications of a constrained mechanics methodology in economics',
    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +
      'physics education. The aim of the paper is: 1. to meet the demand for\n' +
      'illustrative examples suitable for presenting the background of the highly\n' +
      'expanding research field of econophysics even on the undergraduate level and 2.\n' +
      'to enable the students to understand deeper the principles and methods\n' +
      'routinely used in mechanics by looking at the well known methodology from the\n' +
      'different perspective of economics. Two constrained dynamic economic problems\n' +
      'are presented using the economic terminology in an intuitive way. First, the\n' +
      'Phillips model of business cycle is presented as a system of forced\n' +
      'oscillations and the general problem of two interacting economies is solved by\n' +
      'the nonholonomic dynamics approach. Second, the Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey model of\n' +
      'economical growth is solved as a variational problem with a velocity dependent\n' +
      'constraint using the vakonomic approach. The specifics of the solution\n' +
      'interpretation in economics compared to mechanics is discussed in detail, a\n' +
      'discussion of the nonholonomic and vakonomic approaches to constrained problems\n' +
      'in mechanics and economics is provided and an economic interpretation of the\n' +
      'Lagrange multipliers (possibly surprising for the students of physics) is\n' +

    summary: 'Massive open online courses (MOOCs) promise to make rigorous higher education\n' +

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    summary: 'The development of science depends on the basics and principles of Science and scientific research in this science or field, and due to the fact that the nature of the science and field of accounting is developing and improving continuously and rapidly associated with many relationships and fields under many variables and factors, and then this research deals with difficulties between the three variables represented in scientific research, accounting education, and AI, specifically under of the widespread reliance on the preparation and preparation of scientific research using many advanced methods of AI, and then increasing the connection between and the development provided by scientific research. Accounting science and what is repeated in different formats follow the methods of AI. The research also aims to clarify the relationship between AI, accounting education, and accounting scientific research by conducting a questionnaire on a sample of 84 university professors and researchers in the field of accounting. The statistical analysis of the data collected by applying SPSS 25. It was concluded that the relationship between the three variables is considered close and interconnected. Without the first (accounting education), the development of the second (accounting scientific research) stops, which is considered inappropriate for the current business environment in all its categories, whether teaching or learning. Both scientific research and accounting education depend on the latter (AI) to provide technical and analytical support and classify opinions to reduce repetition and avoid deficiencies in the feasibility of research in accounting education.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Chores Participation, Self-Efficacy, and Transition Readiness in Youths With Diabetes: Preliminary Results.',
    abstract: 'This study investigated the relationship of chores participation, diabetes management self-efficacy and transition readiness among adolescents with diabetes. Fifty-four youths participated (average age 13.5 years). The CHORES survey evaluated chore participation, the STARx questionnaire assessed health care transition readiness, and the Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale (PDSMS) assessed self-efficacy. Results showed that involvement in chores was positively correlated with transition readiness scores ( = .404,  < .05) and important subdomains of transition, namely self-management and provider communication. Mediation analysis found that self-efficacy significantly influenced the link between chores and transition readiness. This suggests that when adolescents assume more household responsibilities, they may develop greater confidence in managing their diabetes, which in turn enhances their readiness for the health care transition. Encouraging chores participation can improve transition readiness directly and indirectly, through self-efficacy. Understanding these mechanisms is key in designing patient education programs, or psychosocial interventions to support transition. Implications for health care providers and parents are discussed.',

    title: 'Neural Mechanisms of Decision Making Under Risk of Punishment: Insights From Rodent Models.',
    abstract: 'There are few cognitive functions more essential than decision making, as better decisions improve our chances of survival. Cost-benefit decisions as they apply to most scenarios in the developed world can range from relatively mundane to reasonably important; however, particularly risky choices such as speeding on our way to work or consuming suspicious foods can pose a genuine risk of significant harm or illness. How is it that our brains learn and evaluate these risks and rewards to arrive at decisions? Additionally, what drives some of us to continue despite, or avoid because of, potential adverse consequences? This review explores neural mechanisms underlying cost-benefit decision making, focusing on paradigms used in human and particularly rodent studies to model decision making under the risk of explicit punishments, such as pain, discomfort, or loss. The review focuses on several key brain regions (the prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, and striatum), and their roles in the assessment of rewards, punishments (or risk thereof), and motivated behaviors. It also discusses pertinent literature on the role of dopamine arising from the ventral tegmental area, as a neuromodulator critical for learning and reinforcement in the context of risky decision making. This article is categorized under: Neuroscience > Behavior Economics > Individual Decision-Making Psychology > Reasoning and Decision Making.',

    title: "Assessment of Rheumatologists' Perspectives on Uveitis Management: A Cross-Sectional Nationwide Survey.",
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical approaches, decision-making processes, and interdisciplinary collaboration patterns of rheumatologists in Turkiye in the context of uveitis management.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted using a structured 24-item online questionnaire developed based on current literature and expert consensus. A total of 113 rheumatologists from various institutions across Turkiye completed the survey. Participants were divided into two groups based on clinical experience (≤5 years vs.  >5 years). The survey explored topics such as clinical exposure to uveitis, referral practices, diagnostic and treatment approaches, collaboration with ophthalmologists, and perceived need for further education.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Rheumatologists with greater clinical experience reported more frequent uveitis cases and were more likely to initiate biological therapy. Immediate referral to ophthalmologists was the predominant approach across both groups; however, communication difficulties were cited as a major barrier to effective interdisciplinary collaboration. Adalimumab emerged as the most commonly prescribed biological agent, particularly in Behçet's disease. Financial barriers, such as the cost of medications and reimbursement issues, were frequently reported as limiting factors. A strong demand for further education on uveitis was noted, especially among early-career rheumatologists, with multidisciplinary meetings and online modules being the most preferred formats.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: The findings highlight variability in clinical practices and underline the need for enhanced coordination between rheumatologists and ophthalmologists. Addressing communication barriers and implementing standardized treatment protocols, supported by targeted educational initiatives, may improve collaborative care and patient outcomes in uveitis management.',

Only 17% reported radiation oncology specific training, but 58% had plans to further their education. 80% reported being satisfied with their career and position, believing their role was recognised and generally respected among colleagues and patients. Areas of dissatisfaction included salary, staffing resources and opportunities for advancement.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This is the largest study of RONs in Australia, revealing that RON is a satisfying oncology specialty. Data from this study can be used to identify opportunities for improvement in staffing, engagement and retention of RONs, possibly leading to the development of national guidelines for radiation oncology nursing in Australia.',

    title: 'Expectations, Experiences and Contexts of European Midwives Pursuing a Doctoral Degree: A Twenty-Three-Country Exploratory Survey.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing number of doctorally prepared midwives in Europe, particularly after the Bologna Declaration 1999, little is known about the context and experiences of their doctoral education.\n' +
      "AIM: To explore European initially qualified midwives' experiences with doctoral education; and the context of their education through their professional associations.\n" +
      'DESIGN: An exploratory descriptive observational survey.\n' +
      'METHODS: An ethically approved web-based survey was used to collect data from midwifery associations and midwives in 33 European countries between October and December 2024. Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis were used to analyse the responses.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Twenty-two midwifery associations from 19 European countries and 207 midwives from 23 European countries participated. Over the last two decades, there has been an increase in the number of doctorally prepared midwives. Common reasons to gain doctoral qualifications included an interest in research, career progression, in particular in education, and improving healthcare. Midwives reported growing availability of European-wide opportunities for doctoral programmes, alongside an increase in the number of doctoral midwifery programmes and supervisors with midwifery expertise. Although many barriers were reported, effectively combining study with their personal life and support from family, friends and colleagues was highlighted as crucial factors in completing their doctoral studies.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: This is the first study exploring the experiences of European midwives pursuing a doctoral degree. The findings highlight a need for universities to improve the collaboration with midwives' supportive networks as well as for the profession to reduce intraprofessional hostilities to enhance doctoral midwifery students' well-being. Implications for the profession: Acknowledging challenges faced by these midwives is necessary to improve professional and institutional support in academia and midwifery.\n" +
      'IMPACT: Findings of this study inform strategies to improve doctoral education for midwives and, in this way, strengthen the contributions of midwives to maternal evidenced-based care development and healthcare innovations.\n' +

    title: 'A Multidisciplinary Analysis for Clinical Implications of Denture Use in Patients Presenting With Deep Neck Infections.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Deep neck infection (DNI) is a potentially life-threatening condition, most commonly arising from odontogenic sources. Dentures frequently act as reservoirs for polymicrobial biofilms, facilitating the persistence and potential transmission of oral pathogens. Despite their widespread use, the role of dentures in predisposing individuals to DNI has not been thoroughly investigated. This study seeks to elucidate the possible association between denture use and the incidence of DNI, thereby addressing a gap in the current understanding of orodental risk factors in DNIs.\n' +
      'METHODS: A total of 337 patients diagnosed with DNI between August 2018 and July 2024 were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Among them, 29 individuals were identified as denture wearers. Relevant clinical parameters, including demographic data, comorbidities, infection characteristics, and treatment outcomes, were systematically analyzed to assess potential associations with denture use.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Involvement of the parapharyngeal ( = .0172), submandibular ( = .0190), and parotid ( = .0213) spaces in DNI was significantly more frequent in patients with dentures compared to those without. Univariate analysis identified age ≥60 years (odds ratio [OR] 27.000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5034-291.19;  = .0010), C-reactive protein (CRP) level ≥220 mg/L (OR 8.5000; 95% CI, 1.2471-57.933;  = .0201), and involvement of ≥3 deep neck spaces (OR 8.4444; 95% CI, 1.2261-58.159;  = .0258) as significant risk factors for prolonged hospitalization. However, in multivariate logistic regression analysis, only age ≥60 years remained a significant independent predictor of prolonged hospitalization (OR 18.494; 95% CI, 1.5789-216.63;  = .0201).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: In patients with DNI who wore dentures, univariate analysis identified age 60 years or older, CRP levels of 220 mg/L or higher, and involvement of three or more deep neck spaces as significant predictors of prolonged hospitalization. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that only age 60 years or older remained an independent risk factor for extended hospital stay. These findings highlight the need for targeted health education and preventive measures in elderly denture users to reduce the risk of severe DNI and its complications.',

    title: "Students' Perceptions of Social Media Use as a Learning Tool in Dental Education: A Cross-Sectional Survey.",
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: This survey study aims to investigate the extent and purposes of using social media as a learning tool by dental students during their education process and to raise awareness among educators in this field. It is of interest whether social media platforms, such as YouTube, which are rich in theoretical and practical visuals in various professional fields, support the learning process in dental education as well, and what the attitudes of our students are toward this subject.\n' +
      'MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to conduct the study, a survey consisting of Likert-type and multiple-choice questions was prepared to be administered to first-, second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-year students of Faculty of Dentistry Muğla Sıtkı Kocman University. Printed survey forms were distributed to the faculty students who were invited through an announcement poster, collected by an independent assistant unrelated to the research, and delivered to the responsible researcher.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The responses to the fully and accurately completed survey questions were analyzed using the SPSS 20 program, and the results were compared through Pearson's chi-square analysis based on N and % values.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: Despite students expressing a clear need for formal academic education and perceiving social media as a supplementary resource, academic level, gender, and clinical phase play a critical role in shaping students' perceptions of social media as a learning tool. Also, prosthetic and restorative dentistry are the most preferred specialties for watching videos.",

    title: 'The evolving role of genetic counselors in South Africa: A decade of growth.',
    abstract: 'Genetic counseling has evolved from focusing solely on congenital anomaly prevention to incorporating psychological counseling. Traditionally, its goal has been to enhance patient care by providing clinical information and facilitating psychological adjustment. However, with the rise of genomics and complex testing technologies, genetic counselors now engage in education, research, clinical practice, and laboratory roles. A previous study from 2013 described the role of genetic counselors in South Africa. This current study provides an updated perspective on these findings and how these roles have diversified. Registered independent genetic counselors were invited via email to complete an electronic survey adapted from the previous study conducted in 2013. The survey collected data on information pertaining to (1) demographics, (2) genetic counseling experience and employment, and (3) work/clinical practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Of 44 contacted genetic counselors, 29 responded. Most were female (97%), under 40 years old (60%), and had practiced for less than 10 years (59%). Although many genetic counselors took on multiple responsibilitiessuch as clinical, administrative, research, and teaching-the proportion primarily working in clinical roles declined from 75% (12/16) in 2013 to 45% (10/22) in 2023. Notably, genetic counselors involved in teaching and training had significantly fewer years in practice (p = 0.0396; CI 95%), suggesting a loss of expertise in academic centers. A new trend observed since 2013 is laboratory-based responsibilities, with 68% of participants reporting duties in this area. The role of genetic counselors in South Africa has expanded substantially over the past decade, with a shift away from predominantly clinical roles. These findings highlight the need for adaptation of training programs and strategic workforce planning to retain expertise in academic centers and ensure the continued growth of the profession.',

    title: 'What Community Members With Chronic Illness Teach Future Healthcare Professionals in a Longitudinal Interprofessional Education Program: A Focus Group Study.',
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Nearly 50% of Americans have at least one chronic illness. Preparing future healthcare providers for interprofessional collaborative practice (IPCP) and person-centred care through community-based interprofessional education (IPE) can improve outcomes for this growing population. Partial programme theories predict that patients' participation as teachers in health professions education contributes to students' development of patient-centredness. Role theory asserts that behaviours are shaped by assigned roles; therefore, community members with chronic illness who assume roles of health mentors in an IPE curriculum are predicted to teach students about their patient experiences. Yet, this teaching outcome and the lessons health mentors teach in semi-structured student-led meetings are underexplored.\n" +
      'GOALS: This project explored what community members with chronic conditions teach future healthcare professionals about their conditions/disabilities and healthcare access and quality in a health mentors IPE programme.\n' +
      'METHODS: Thirty-eight health mentors participated in focus groups and were surveyed for demographic information. Directed content analysis was performed, drawing on prior research, programme theory and core competencies in IPCP and disability.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Four themes were identified related to barriers in accessing healthcare: environmental factors, insurance, cost and time. Themes regarding chronic conditions, disabilities or healthcare quality included education about the patient journey, communication, person-centred care, team collaboration, advocacy, empathy, impact of providers' words and shared decision-making.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Partial programme theories suggest these lessons are especially impactful when delivered by patients. Aligned with role theory, our findings suggest that clinical teachers can rely on health mentors to share key lessons with students within a semistructured student-led context.',

    title: 'Trends in the Acquisition of Clinical Reasoning in the Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders: Using the Script Concordance Test.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Clinical reasoning is essential for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) when addressing ill-defined questions in various clinical settings. This study focuses on the acquisition of clinical reasoning skills in SLP students, particularly their evolution with clinical experience. To achieve this, the study developed and validated the first cloud-based script concordance test (SCT) tailored for assessing clinical reasoning skills in SSD diagnosis.\n' +
      'METHODS: An expert panel of 15 SLPs (average experience of 20.3 years) helped develop and score the SCT, which was administered to 51 undergraduate students (22 sophomores, 18 juniors, and 11 seniors). Statistical analyses examined the predictive role and trend of clinical experience in three dimensions (utility, interpretation, and diagnosis).\n' +
      'RESULTS: A significant difference in mean SCT scores was found between the expert panel and student groups (p < 0.05). Trend analysis showed a significant impact of clinical experience on SCT performance across all dimensions (all Fs > 9.91, p < 0.001), with greater experience linked to better reasoning skills. Low-scoring items highlighted challenges with stimulability testing, indicating a lack of clinical consensus.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that clinical reasoning skills in SSD assessment become more refined with accumulated experience. The SCT developed effectively differentiates reasoning abilities between experts and students, offering a valuable tool for advancing clinical decision-making in speech-language pathology. These findings have practical implications, empowering SLP educators to design effective training programs and preparing students for the challenges they may face in clinical practice.\n' +
      "WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject? The knowledge base of clinical practitioners includes both content and its organization. Clinical reasoning is the cognitive ability to integrate, organize, and interpret information as a key aspect of expertise in evidence-based practice. Recently, script concordance tests, which use case-based scenarios to reflect clinical decision-making processes, have become a popular method for assessing these reasoning skills. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? This study is the first to empirically show that clinical reasoning skills in speech-language pathology, particularly in assessing speech sound disorders, are progressively refined through clinical experience. It highlights that students' reasoning skills during internships appear to be influenced by supervisory clinical approaches, potentially affecting diagnostic abilities. These reasoning skills may improve with further clinical experience or targeted continuing education. Additionally, the study developed the first SCT focused on SSD evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between expert and student clinical reasoning and decision-making abilities. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? A recent goal in clinical education is to make clinical reasoning processes more explicit and structured during training. Creating comprehensive case assessment scripts and designing concrete clinical thinking guidance programs integrated with effective measurement, such as the SCT developed in this study, could serve as teaching objectives for the clinical diagnosis of SSD.",
