    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'The Effectiveness of 3D Virtual Environments for BPMN Teaching: A Quasi-Experimental Study',
    summary: 'Traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, being static and highly abstract, often hinder comprehension, particularly for novice designers and students. This can lead to misinterpretations and process inefficiencies. In this study, we investigate whether immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments can enhance the understanding of BPMN models. We developed a virtual reality (VR)-based BPMN visualization tool and conducted a quasi -experiment with 48 academic and professional participants, who interacted with a 3D BPMN model using Google Cardboard and a joystick. Participants completed comprehension tasks before and after the VR experience. The results show significant improvements in understanding and engagement, suggesting that immersive virtual reality can be a valuable educational tool for BPMN learning. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the integration of 3D environments in process modeling education, offering benefits for both academic and professional training.',

    title: 'Assessing the role of artificial intelligence in quality of legal education with special reference to sustainable development goal',
    summary: 'The transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly apparent in a variety of fields, including legal education. This study investigates the potential of AI in transforming legal education in order to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), 2030. As nations and cultures global struggle to achieve the SDGs, legal professionals play an important role in establishing legal frameworks that support progress toward these goals. It can improve the delivery of legal curricula by providing customized learning experiences targeted to individuals. AI can also help educators to create current content and enhance the evaluation. Education is now more dynamic, accessible, and affordable, expanding its reach. Quality of legal education is a cornerstone of achieving the SDGs set for 2030. The effective utilization of AI in the field of legal education holds significant promise in not only expanding access but also improving the quality of legal education. AI-powered legal research tools have the potential to revolutionize legal research for law students, researchers, and legal practitioners. They can provide more efficient and comprehensive ways to explore legal precedents, case law, and statutes, thus empowering legal professionals to perform their duties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By improving access to legal information, these tools can play a significant role in the formulation of laws and regulations that align with the SDGs. This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which AI can contribute to advancing legal education and, consequently, supporting the attainment of the SDGs.',

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. These instructional strategies aim to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a tool that can promote substantive student involvement and meaningful learning. (An initial draft of this abstract was produced by ChatGPT 4.0, but GenAI was not used in any other way for this article, other than as an interactive partner within the excerpts as clearly marked.)',

    title: 'Making Tens with Four Hands: Touchscreen-Based Classroom Activity for Early Number Learning',
    summary: 'As schools increasingly embrace embodied learning, there is a growing need to incorporate classroom teaching and learning activities that recognize the body’s role as both an individual and collective resource for cognition and instruction. In response, we present a design for a classroom teaching sequence focused on early number learning, featuring pedagogical activities supported by TouchCounts (TC) and engaged by pairs of children using their four hands. These activities showcase the potential of embodied learning for children to explore concepts such as odd and even numbers, as well as the composition and decomposition of numbers up to and including ten. We elaborate on the functionalities of TC, outline the teaching sequence, and offer episodes of our classroom observations. Specifically, we present three lesson snapshots aimed at first-graders (aged 6 to 7) using a class set of TC, student learning outcomes, and notable observations as students interact with the touchscreen environment. For example, we note that the student pairs used their hands to reinforce, extend, and redirect mathematical ideas; besides, they developed a collective discourse through (gestural) subitizing the number of fingers that they (and their partner) put up (and folded down). This snapshot explicates the collective learning experiences in classroom settings involving pair-work activities and informs existing work on embodied (mathematical) cognition beyond how students learn with their bodies individually.',

    summary: 'In this article, we investigate the effects of the app Fingu on a child’s understanding of the part-whole concept. Using the Artifact Centric Activity Theory framework, we initially analyse the internalisation and externalisation processes that appear to occur during one child’s use of the app. Based on the learning from this process, we then use other aspects of the framework, in particular the subject-artifact-group triangle, to understand how Fingu might be used productively in mathematics education classrooms. Using a 13-min video of a child playing Fingu as our data source, we analyse how children might, as they learn about part-whole relationships, interact with the game. We also investigate how design principles in creating apps can impact on the experience of using the app in ways that may be unintended by their designers. This work has implications for app designers and for mathematics educators seeking to incorporate digital technologies into mathematics education.',

    title: 'Characterizing Severe and Level 2 Hypoglycemia and Associated Risk Factors in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Using Hybrid Closed-Loop Insulin Pumps.',
    abstract: ' Despite advances in diabetes technologies, severe hypoglycemia (SH) and level 2 hypoglycemia (Lv2Hypo) persist among hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin pump users. This study assessed the relationship of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and other patient characteristics with SH and Lv2Hypo in HCL insulin pump users with type 1 diabetes.  A cross-sectional survey assessed 6-month SH history, hemoglobin A1C, IAH (using the Hypoglycemia Awareness Questionnaire), and 30-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data among adult HCL insulin pump users recruited from a national U.S. type 1 diabetes patient registry. Analyses included logistic regression, -tests, and Chi-square tests.  Of 601 participants (female: 54%; mean age: 43), IAH and higher glucose coefficients of variation (CVs) were associated with both SH and spending ≥1% of time in Lv2Hypo (s < 0.05). Individuals with SH were further characterized as having spent more time with glucose levels >180 mg/dL and >250 mg/dL and having a lower education level (s < 0.05). CGM hypoglycemia measures were not associated with SH. Age and diabetes duration were not associated with experiencing SH or spending ≥1% of time in Lv2Hypo. Participants who both experienced SH and spent ≥1% of time in Lv2Hypo showed trends toward exhibiting the most severe IAH and the highest glucose CVs.  Among adults with type 1 diabetes using HCL insulin pumps, IAH and higher glucose CVs are risk factors of experiencing SH and Lv2Hypo. Hyperglycemia and lower education level are also associated with a higher risk for experiencing SH.',

    title: "Psychiatric Residents' Perspectives on Psychedelics and Psychedelic Assisted Therapy.",
    abstract: "This study evaluated the attitudes, knowledge, and educational experiences of psychiatry residents regarding psychedelics and psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT). In 2023, we distributed an anonymous survey to United States psychiatry residents, assessing demographics, knowledge, and opinions on psychedelics/PAT. The survey also included items asking respondents to retrospectively self-report how strongly psychedelic-related work and educational opportunities influenced their career choice and ranking of residency programs in the Match. Of the 109 respondents, most reported limited formal education on psychedelics during training but expressed a strong desire for more instruction. Most believed psychedelics hold promise for psychiatric disorders (83.49%), though fewer saw similar potential for substance use disorders (55.96%). Notably, 39.81% reported psychedelic-related educational or research opportunities influenced residency program rankings, and 39.25% indicated the possibility of treating patients with psychedelics influenced their decision to pursue psychiatry. Higher knowledge scores and stronger belief in psychedelics' therapeutic potential were associated with greater self-reported influence of psychedelic-related opportunities on program ranking. This study is limited by its small sample size and potential for self-selection and recall bias. Overall, psychiatry residents demonstrated optimism about psychedelics' therapeutic potential but reported inadequate training. Expanding psychedelic-focused educational content in residency could better prepare trainees for psychedelics' evolving role in psychiatry.",

    title: 'Cognitive functioning in young adults after mild COVID-19: A case-control study from Iran.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused widespread infection across global populations, characterized by its high transmissibility. Despite extensive research on the acute effects of COVID-19, the long-term psychological and neurological sequela remain inadequately explored. This study aimed to investigate cognitive function after COVID-19 infection compared to a control group of non-infected subjects.\n' +
      'METHODS: This case-control study included 40 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19, referred to Imam Reza Referral and Educational Hospital in Mashhad, Iran, and 40 matched controls who had not experienced COVID-19 symptoms. All participants underwent an initial screening by a psychiatric assistant to exclude significant medical and psychiatric conditions and any history of drug use. A demographic checklist was administered, followed by cognitive assessments using the Stroop Test, Digit Span Test, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Data were analysed using SPSS Version 20.\n' +
      'RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding age, sex, education level, marital status, or employment status (p > 0.05). However, COVID-19-infected individuals exhibited significantly longer completion times for the congruent Stroop test and increased reaction times compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Additionally, the duration for completing the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was significantly longer in the infected group compared to the non-infected group (p < 0.001). Although the longest digit span and scores on the Digit Span Test were lower in the infected group, these differences did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05). Furthermore, reaction times in the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) for the first, second, and third sets of 50 stimuli were significantly greater in the COVID-19 group (p < 0.001).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: This study underscores that cognitive performance post-COVID-19 is adversely affected, particularly in terms of processing speed and sustained attention, when compared to healthy individuals. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to explore potential interventions for cognitive rehabilitation in this population.',

    title: 'Knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding avian influenza among poultry farmers near migratory bird habitats in Guidong County, China.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To assess the knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behaviors (KAP) regarding avian influenza among poultry farmers living near migratory bird habitats in Guidong County, China, and to identify determinants of these practices using structural equation modeling.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in July 2021 among 221 poultry farmers from three towns adjacent to migratory bird habitats. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on KAP related to avian influenza. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze KAP levels. A structural equation model was developed with AMOS 24.0 to examine the relationships among knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The overall mean KAP score was 32.97 ± 7.95 (51.5%) of maximum possible score, indicating suboptimal levels. In the fitted model, knowledge exerted both a direct effect on preventive behaviors (standardized path coefficient = 0.183) and an indirect effect mediated through attitudes (0.056). Attitude additionally influenced behavior directly (0.181). Goodness-of-fit indices confirmed robust model fit.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Study findings indicate that poultry farmers living near migratory bird habitats in Guidong County demonstrate insufficient avian influenza-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Targeted health education that enhances accurate knowledge and fosters positive attitudes is critical to strengthening preventive behaviors and mitigating transmission risk.',

    title: 'Spatiotemporal analysis of pulmonary tuberculosis in the central region of the Zhejiang Province, China (2016-2024).',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In recent years, Shaoxing City, located in central Zhejiang Province, has experienced a slow decline in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate the potential causes for this decline through spatiotemporal analyses to provide a scientific basis for targeted prevention and control. We aimed to explore the spatiotemporal distribution of PTB notification rates in Shaoxing City from 2016 to 2024 and identify high-incidence clusters, thereby offering data-driven insights to optimize regional PTB control strategies.\n' +
      'METHODS: Statistical analyses were conducted using R and Excel on all reported active PTB cases in Shaoxing City. Spatiotemporal analysis of case distribution and regional clustering was conducted using ArcGIS and SatScan.\n' +
      'RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In total, 17,298 active PTB cases were registered between 2016 and 2024, including 9,749 laboratory-confirmed and 7,549 clinically diagnosed cases. The male-to-female ratio was 2.34:1. Farmers represented 68.2% of all cases. The PTB notification incidence showed a gradual decline. Spatial autocorrelation results revealed 52 sub-districts with high-high clusters over the nine-year period, primarily in Shengzhou and Xinchang counties. Spatiotemporal scan analysis identified one primary cluster area ( = 1.62,  = 170.87,  < 0.001) and two secondary clusters between 2016 and 2024. The incidence of PTB in Shaoxing City showed a downward trend, though the decline was relatively slow. The southeastern region should be prioritized in efforts to accelerate the End TB Strategy. Overall, comprehensive and intensive interventions, such as large-scale chest X-ray screening and health education programs, should be enhanced to effectively curb PTB transmission, especially among males and farmers.',

    title: 'Alpha-Gal Syndrome: Often Hidden, Under-Recognized, and in Need of Attention-A Rapid Review.',
    abstract: "Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), a tick-borne allergy, is increasing as its vectors migrate throughout the US and the world. There were an estimated 450,000 cases in the US. AGS reactions to mammalian foods and medical products include delayed anaphylaxis, urticaria, gastrointestinal and cardiac symptoms often difficult to connect to the source. Despite its seriousness, provider knowledge is limited. This rapid review investigated published works on AGS from 2020 to 24; it also sought to determine the breadth of AGs publications across different fields and specialties. We identified 355 studies of AGS diagnosis and management from 2020 to 2024 via Cochrane Central, Medline via the PubMed interface, and Embase (additional grey literature via Web of Science and Google Scholar). Studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias using JBI critical appraisal tools. Two hundred and nineteen studies met the criteria. One hundred and sixty-eight (77%) were full studies; 51 (23%) were conference presentations. Studies remained largely confined to allergy and immunology literature, despite their implications for other organ systems. Although patients present with symptoms to emergency departments and dermatology clinics there is a paucity of literature in those fields and others; several studies document practitioners' lack of knowledge. Inclusion of content within medical school curricula is needed to establish foundational knowledge on the topic. With the increase in patients presenting with AGS, and with the reach of AGS across multiple fields, physicians and other health care providers need to be able to diagnose and then manage AGS with their patients. This rapid review has documented the problem of silos in disseminating information about AGS widely through the medical field. The remedy for a lack of practitioner knowledge is education.",

    title: 'Empirical Research of Health Inequalities Between Male and Female Employees of the Hellenic National Organization for Healthcare Services Provision: A Cross-Sectional Study.',
    abstract: 'Aim The study attempts to delineate a framework of investigation regarding health inequalities and health-related behaviors among male and female employees of the Hellenic National Organization for Healthcare Services Provision (EOPYY). The pillars of the presented framework are self-perceived health, the presence of chronic diseases, health behaviors, mental well-being, and healthcare utilization. Subject and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 209 employees using a self-administered online questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, as well as Chi-squared Χ²) and multiple linear regression analysis. Results Men reported better overall health, lower stress levels, and higher quality of life, particularly in dimensions such as physical pain (p=0.001) and mental health (p=0.002), whereas women reported a higher prevalence of chronic diseases and more frequent doctor visits. Women adopted healthier dietary habits and exercised more frequently, while men exhibited higher rates of overweight and obesity (p<0.001). Gender emerged as a significant predictor of both physical and mental health, with men demonstrating more favorable health indicators. Conclusions While health inequalities are gaining global attention, their impact on employees in large public Organizations in Greece remains underexplored. This study generates novel insights to shape strategies such as flexible work policies, improved workplace health programs, and gender equality education, driving a more inclusive and supportive work culture. Practical implications include workplace mental health support, targeted health promotion initiatives, and policies enhancing work-life balance. These measures can reduce gender-related health disparities and improve overall employee well-being and productivity. The findings may inform workplace health policies and promote gender-sensitive interventions in the public sector.

    title: 'Unraveling Benign Breast Conditions: A Comprehensive Study of Diagnosis, Treatment, and Care.',
    abstract: 'Introduction  The breast undergoes cyclical changes influenced by hormones, with benign breast diseases (BBDs) being more common than malignant conditions. These conditions can present with symptoms such as lumps, pain, swelling, and nipple discharge. This study investigates the incidence, clinical features, age distribution, and management of BBDs, providing insight into the common breast-related issues that affect women across different stages of life. Methodology  A prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from August 2021 to December 2022, including 100 patients with breast-related complaints. Participants underwent detailed history, clinical examination, and relevant investigations such as ultrasonography, mammography, and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Data were analyzed using Excel and SPSS, with continuous variables presented as mean ± standard deviation and categorical data as numbers and percentages. Results In the present study, the mean age of the 100 participants with BBD was 34.98±11.97 years, with the majority (78/100, 78%) presenting with lumps. Fibroadenoma was the most common diagnosis, seen in 59/100 (59%), followed by fibroadenosis in 19/100 (19%) and breast abscess in 16/100 (16%). The mean age of menarche among patients with BBD was 14.52±1.80 years, with 56/100 (56%) attaining menarche between 13 and 15 years. Additionally, 81/100 (81%) were married, and 10/100 (10%) had a history of lactation. The majority of patients with BBD had lumps in the right upper outer quadrant, with most lumps being firm and mobile, and 97/100 (97%) showed no axillary lymph node involvement. Most patients were treated with excision, while others received conservative treatment with reassurance, analgesics, and antibiotics, with diagnosis confirmed through ultrasonography and mammography. Discussion The spectrum of BBDs in our study aligns with findings from other studies, with fibroadenoma being the most prevalent lesion, followed by fibrocystic changes. These conditions predominantly affect young women under the age of 40 in our population. Conclusion In conclusion, BBDs, particularly fibroadenoma, are common and require accurate clinical assessment, with FNAC being a reliable diagnostic tool. Early detection through breast self-examination and regular follow-ups, along with continued education on benign breast conditions, is essential for effective management and patient care.',

    title: 'Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants in Saudi Arabia: A Four-Year Single-Center Experience.',
    abstract: "Introduction Globally, extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants present a distinct challenge for neonatologists, representing a significant portion of the most vulnerable and high-risk cases admitted to the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Saudi Arabia has a high prevalence of ELBW, which leads to a significant risk of morbidity and mortality, as many of these extreme preterm infants who are admitted to NICUs may not survive till discharge. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of ELBW infants and associated risk factors over a four-year period. Methods Two study designs were used in this research: a cross-sectional retrospective design was used for estimating the prevalence rate over four years, and a case-control study with a retrospective chart review for the risk factor correlation. The study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, covering four years, from January 2017 to December 2020. All newborn live infants born at KAMC who weighed 1000 grams or less were included in the study. Infants born outside KAMC and those with fatal anomalies were excluded from the study. The pregnancy notes on the mothers were reviewed blindly, with no knowledge of the newborn's outcome. Statistical data were analyzed using SPSS version 26. Results A total of 256 ELBW infants were recorded out of 36,000 live births. The prevalence of ELBW during the study period of four years was 0.71%. Of the ELBW infants, 57.4% had a birth weight between 750 and 1000 grams, while 42.6% weighed less than 750 grams. Lower gestational age and prolonged rupture of membrane (PROM) were associated with a birth weight of 750-1000 g, whereas twin and triplet births were associated with a birth weight of <750 g. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between birth weight and maternal age, but birth weight was inversely correlated with gestational age. Conclusion There was a minimal incidence rate of ELBW during the four-year duration. Significant risk factors for birth weight <750 g were triplets and twins, while lower gestational age and PROM were significant risk factors for birth weight of 750-1000 g. Interventions focusing on improving antenatal care access, maternal health education, and nutritional status may help reduce the prevalence of ELBW in our region.",

    title: 'Artificial Intelligence in Peripheral Artery Disease Education: A Battle Between ChatGPT and Google Gemini.',
    abstract: "Background Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a prevalent yet often overlooked manifestation of atherosclerosis that significantly contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. With the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for medical information, it is essential to assess the accuracy and readability of AI-generated health content, especially with regard to common cardiovascular diseases. Objective This study evaluates the accuracy, completeness, and readability of responses generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT (San Francisco, CA) and Google's Gemini (Mountain View, CA) when answering common questions about PAD. AI responses were compared to Cleveland Clinic's frequently asked questions (FAQs) on PAD to assess the reliability of AI-generated responses as a patient education tool. Methods ChatGPT 4.0 and Gemini 1.0 were prompted in three formats (no prompt (Form 1), patient-level prompt (Form 2), and physician-level prompt (Form 3)) before answering 19 questions from Cleveland Clinic's FAQs on PAD. Responses were categorized as correct, partially correct, or incorrect based on percent content alignment. Readability was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid (FK) grade level, and word count differences were analyzed. Chi-square tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analysis, with a significance threshold of p < 0.05. Results ChatGPT provided 70% correct and 30% partially correct responses, with no incorrect answers. Gemini provided 52% correct, 45% partially correct, and 3% incorrect responses. ChatGPT performed significantly better in accuracy, with a p-value < 0.05. FK analysis showed no significant readability differences between the two chatbots (mean FK grade: ChatGPT, 10.81; Gemini, 10.73), although both were higher than the recommended reading level for patient education. ChatGPT's responses were significantly longer than Gemini's, with a p-value < 0.0001. Conclusion Both ChatGPT and Gemini provided mostly accurate and comprehensive responses to commonly asked questions about PAD, demonstrating their potential use as supplementary education tools for patients with appropriate provider oversight. However, the grade reading level of these materials exceeded the recommended reading levels set forth by national guidelines, which warrants improvement in AI-driven health communication. Given the growing reliance on AI in healthcare, further research should explore ways to enhance AI-generated medical content for broader patient accessibility and evaluate its impact on patient outcomes.",
