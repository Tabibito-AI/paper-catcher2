    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'Teaching climate complacency: mainstream economics textbooks and the need for transformation in economics education',
    abstract: 'ABSTRACT In this paper we ask, what is mainstream economics education conveying to its students? Standard mainstream economics textbooks treat the environment as a specialist issue in addition to standard concerns and based on solutions that conform to those standard concerns. When viewed as socialisation for students this is a major problem. To illustrate the problems we set out key aspects of the standard format, and draw attention to the structure and contents from two well-known textbooks. Standard textbooks convey the impression that the ‘environmental issue’ is appropriately incorporated and exhibit two complacency-creating features. First, fundamental problems (acute global ecological breakdown, biodiversity loss, climate change crisis etc), issues and urgency cannot be adequately conveyed to students within this way of framing economics. Second, specific theory and policy solutions suggest that the problem is well in hand. We illustrate using the theory of negative externalities.',

    title: 'Leaf economics of deciduous and evergreen plants: how do they exhibit trait optimization under resource variations and environmental constraints',
    summary: 'Leaf habit, whether a plant is deciduous or evergreen, is one of the most conspicuous traits in plant species, ecosystems, and biomes. In this review, we discuss theories and empirical patterns of deciduous and evergreen habits with a focus on the optimal strategies. Historically, optimal leaf habits and leaf lifespans (LL) have been explained from the viewpoints of carbon economy and nutrient use. In the leaf economics spectrum, deciduous and evergreen species are positioned at the resource-acquisitive and resource-conservative sides of the spectrum, respectively. Seasonal variations in leaf traits of deciduous species could be understood simply as optimization of carbon economy in relation to the progress of the growth season. Evergreen species, however, exhibit more complex patterns, which could be understood as acclimation to seasonal environmental changes or resource allocation to leaf replacement and reproduction. Optimal timing of leaf shedding in evergreen species varies depending on the limiting factor for leaf retention. The return on investment (RI) through the lifetime of a leaf should be greater in evergreen species when there is no environmental suppression. However, RI of evergreen species is often suppressed by seasonal environment or species interaction. Deciduous species can have comparable RIs with evergreen species when they can occupy better environment such as gaps in forests. In conclusion, which leaf habit is advantageous can be understood from trait optimization perspectives. Such knowledge should help forecast how forest ecosystems will respond to changing climate and other anthropogenic environmental impacts.',

    title: 'Total reaction time can explain the performance on the literacy and numeracy skills of young people with intellectual disabilities using an augmented reality game',
    summary: 'Evidence suggests a relationship between literacy and numeracy skills and cognitive abilities, which could be improved by augmented reality (AR) games. This study aimed to investigate to what degree the performance in a literacy and numeracy skills AR game explains associations between total reaction time (TRT) and educational achievement measures. Eighty-three participants with intellectual disabilities, aged 6 to 17 (with and without Down syndrome), and 37 participants from public schools with typical development participated in a cross-sectional study. TRT was measured using the TRT_S 2012 software, and performance on AR tasks was assessed with the MoviLetrando game. The analysis of variance revealed that the improvement in TRT overall performance on the second attempt (M = 1.70) compared to the first (M = 1.85) was not significant, with F(1,99.00) = 0.76, p  =.39, ŋ 2 =0.01. Post hoc comparisons indicated that the group with typical development performed significantly faster in overall scores on the TRT scale when compared to the groups with Down syndrome and intellectual disabilities ( p  <.001). These two groups reported similar performances (M = 2.65ms; M = 1.87ms, respectively) in the TRT task after performing the AR game, but both showed lower performance compared to the typical development group (M = 0.59ms), the main effect for group was F(2,99) = 14.04, p  <.01, ŋ 2 =0.22. Educational achievement measures were strongly correlated with TRT and each MoviLetrando subscale. The group with Down syndrome was able to achieve the average time in the most complex task. The performance of participants with intellectual disabilities was delayed compared to their peers with typical development. Educational achievement measures and TRT explain the associations between these performances.',

    title: 'Broad-scale overdose education and naloxone distribution– 5-year follow-up of a regional program in Skåne County, Sweden',
    summary: 'Background Opioid use disorder is a chronic disorder with a high risk of overdose-related morbidity and mortality where a large proportion of these can be averted by timely administration of the antidote naloxone. For naloxone to be present when and where overdoses occur, broad-scale overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) must be established. A regional naloxone program was implemented in 2018, in Skåne County, Sweden. This five-year follow-up aims to describe all naloxone-related lay-person events, whether recommendations previously described in the literature were met, and to further investigate events conducted by individuals reporting overdose reversals with naloxone on three or more occasions (‘Supersavers’). Methods Between June 2018 and June 2023, data was collected in six-month intervals from 52 participating units, containing information on trained individuals, gender, year of birth and distributed naloxone kits. Upon naloxone replenishment, patients were asked whether previous naloxone had been used for overdose reversals on someone else, or themselves, had been lost, stolen, or given to someone else. Targets for naloxone distribution and program enrolment were set to a minimum of 20 kits per annual opioid overdose death, and 100 individuals at-risk per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. Results Training and initial kits were provided to 2685 individuals at risk of own opioid overdose. Upon refill ( n  = 2,364), naloxone had been used for overdose reversal in 39% ( n  = 926) situations. In total, 5900 naloxone kits were distributed. Distribution target in relation to opioid overdose mortality was met annually, while the enrolment target was first met during the second year. The core group of Supersavers represent 9% ( n  = 50) of participants returning for refill while reporting 54.5% ( n  = 292) of all overdose reversals. Conclusions Broad-scale naloxone training and distribution reaches a large proportion of individuals at risk of opioid overdose. A continuous focus and priority in supporting units with a high prevalence of individuals witnessing overdose events is of great importance as these individuals report a large proportion of overdose reversals. Likewise, it is of great importance to provide these individuals, i.e. Supersavers, with needed and sufficient support for their continued essential work intervening in overdose situations.

    title: 'How confident are the general surgeons in Hokkaido region in performing essential trauma skills: a cross-sectional questionnaire survey',
    summary: 'Background In Japan—particularly in the Hokkaido region—a limited number of dedicated trauma surgeons often compels general surgeons to serve as frontline providers of trauma care. However, their ability to perform critical trauma procedures and their level of confidence remain unclear. Understanding this gap is vital for guiding targeted training programs aimed at improving patient outcomes. Although conducted in one region, these findings may inform strategies in other remote or resource-limited settings worldwide, where timely surgical intervention significantly affects survival. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the experience and confidence of general surgeons in Hokkaido in performing 35 essential trauma procedures. Methods This prospective observational study surveyed all general surgeons and surgical residents working in hospitals that regularly perform surgical procedures in Hokkaido. Participants provided demographic information, trauma training history, and self-assessed confidence and experience in performing 35 procedures identified via a previous Delphi study. Confidence was defined as a Likert scale rating of 4 or 5. Comparisons were made between respondents with and without advanced trauma training (e.g., ATOM, DSTC) and between those who had managed more than 50 trauma cases versus fewer than 50. Results Of 730 eligible participants, 444 completed the survey (62.2%). Over half (57.9%) reported fewer than 10 lifetime trauma surgeries, and 64.4% had not managed a trauma case in the past year. Only six procedures were rated confidently (≥ 4) by more than half the respondents, including endotracheal intubation, chest tube placement, and selected gastrointestinal procedures. Subgroup analyses indicated that surgeons generally had higher confidence in procedures related to their subspecialty, whereas less frequent or advanced trauma skills remained areas of concern. Surgeons with advanced trauma training or a higher trauma case volume (> 50) demonstrated significantly greater confidence in multiple trauma-specific skills. Conclusion General surgeons in Hokkaido lack confidence in most essential trauma procedures, particularly those encountered infrequently. Although these findings originate from one region, they underscore training gaps potentially relevant to other remote or resource-limited areas, where frontline trauma care demands targeted, high-yield interventions to improve outcomes.',

    title: 'Revisiting Watkins’ Black Curriculum Orientations: Building on Curricular Contributions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities',
    summary: 'Abstract Watkins’,  Harvard Educational Review, 63 (3), 321–339 ( 1993 ) Black curriculum orientations challenge us to explore education—why we teach, what we teach—in its sociopolitical context, the way it is politically brokered and negotiated, the political ideology to which it tends, the ways it curates our identities, and is responsive to our lived experiences. This study revisits Watkin’s ( 1993 ) conceptualizations of Black curriculum orientations and draws from literature that (1) nuances and complicates these conversations and contentious debates, (2) situates and contextualizes these conversations within the sociopolitical realities of the Black community, and (3) includes and amplifies the voices of HBCU administrators, faculty, and students whose curricular contributions have been historically silenced. To distill the extant literature on Black curriculum orientations, this study surveys peer-reviewed journal articles, scholarly books, memoirs, and archival data that captures conversations from faculty, administrators, and students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) about the purpose, meaning, and value of education. ',

    title: 'Navigating racism: A scoping review of barriers in the experiences of Black Health Professions students',
    summary: "This manuscript examines the racism experienced by Black students in health professions through a scoping review of 33 articles. The analysis reveals significant gaps in the literature across multiple dimensions of racism, including interpersonal, community, institutional and systemic levels. Interpersonal racism, identified in 30% of the studies, demonstrates how discriminatory interactions negatively affect students' academic performance and overall well-being. Community racism, addressed in 24% of the studies, highlights the role of community norms in fostering exclusion and stereotype threat. Institutional racism was minimally addressed, appearing in only 3% of the studies, and focusing primarily on barriers posed by standardized testing. Systemic racism and historical factors received limited attention, with 52% of the studies failing to adequately connect these broader forces to the racialized experiences of Black students. Addressing these gaps is essential for shaping policies that dismantle structural barriers, promote equitable admissions, and expand funding for initiatives that support Black students pursuing health professions. Prioritizing these efforts is critical to creating a more inclusive educational environment, improving student outcomes, and reducing health disparities.",

By integrating these dimensions, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of how PE contributes to adolescent development while accounting for cultural variability. Methods A systematic review was conducted using Web of Science, EBSCO, and Scopus databases. The final search was performed in July 2024. A total of 3,114 non-duplicate articles were identified. After screening titles, abstracts, and full texts, 44 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were assessed based on methodologies, program structures, findings, and alignment with cultural values. Results The review indicates that PE programs integrating moral education contribute to the development of students’ moral and social competencies. Programs appeared to be designed that align with prevailing cultural values and traditions, which may enhance their perceived relevance and acceptance. However, due to the methodological diversity of included studies, direct comparisons across studies were limited. Conclusions The findings suggest that PE-based programs promoting moral and social development are generally effective. Further research, including meta-analyses, is recommended to compare different program approaches systematically. Future studies should also aim to standardize evaluation methods to improve comparability and explicitly consider cultural context as an important factor influencing program design and outcomes.',

    title: 'Strengthening the Kindergarten Teacher’s Manual Based on the NCTM Standards: Proposed Amendments',
    summary: 'There is a prominent and steadily growing interest in mathematics learning in early childhood education. Teaching mathematics is dependent not only on the teachers’ competencies and characteristics but also on the quality of the curricular resources they use, including manuals. In the Palestinian education system, the kindergarten teacher’s manual is the sole official written curriculum resource available for kindergarten education. The purpose of this study is to analyze and strengthen the kindergarten teacher’s manual based on the Standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics by proposing developmental amendments to it. To achieve this purpose, two methods were used: quantitative content analysis of the Kindergarten Teacher’s Manual based on the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Standards and qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with Palestinian early childhood professionals. The results showed that although the Manual was a strong first-draft document; the mathematics content is incomplete, as it does not include all the standards’ expectations for kindergarten; and the sequencing is not logically aligned with children’s developmental progression. This study proposes amendments which are emphasizing early childhood development; re-arranging the Manual to reflect a logical sequence of mathematical skills; adding the complete mathematics content; and a restructuring of the activities themselves. The intended amended manual will have clear and compelling implications in the field and will empower kindergarten teachers to become more confident in teaching and developing the early childhood curriculum in the Palestinian education system. L’apprentissage des mathématiques dans l’éducation de la petite enfance suscite un intérêt croissant. L’enseignement des mathématiques dépend non seulement des compétences et des caractéristiques des enseignants, mais aussi de la qualité des ressources pédagogiques utilisées, y compris les manuels. Dans le système éducatif palestinien, le manuel de l’enseignant de maternelle représente la seule ressource pédagogique officielle écrite disponible pour l’enseignement de la maternelle. L’objectif de cette étude est d’analyser et de renforcer le manuel de l’enseignant de maternelle sur la base des normes du « Conseil national des enseignants de mathématiques» (NCTM, en anglais) en y proposant des modifications en matière de développement. Pour atteindre ce but, nous avons utilisé deux méthodes: une analyse quantitative du contenu du manuel de l’enseignant de maternelle en nous appuyant sur les normes du « Conseil national des enseignants de mathématiques» et une analyse qualitative fondée sur des entrevues semi-structurées avec des professionnels palestiniens de la petite enfance. Les résultats ont montré que, bien que le manuel constitue un document initial de qualité, son contenu en mathématiques est incomplet, car il n’inclut pas toutes les attentes normatives pour la maternelle, et son enchaînement n’est pas aligné de manière logique sur la progression du développement de l’enfant. Dans cette étude, nous proposons les amendements suivants: mettre l’accent sur le développement de la petite enfance, réorganiser le manuel pour offrir une séquence logique de compétences mathématiques, ajouter la totalité du contenu mathématique et restructurer les activités elles-mêmes. Une fois modifié, le manuel attendu aura des implications claires et convaincantes sur le terrain et permettra aux enseignants de maternelle d’être plus confiants dans l’enseignement et le développement du programme destiné à la petite enfance dans le système éducatif palestinien.',

    title: 'Preferences for Nonpharmaceutical Interventions During the Endemic Phase of COVID-19: Discrete Choice Experiment.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective tools for pandemic containment but often impose significant socioeconomic consequences that intensify over time. Public support and compliance to NPIs are crucial to ensure their effectiveness.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to elicit preferences of a Singaporean population for the reintroduction of NPIs in response to the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant during the COVID-19 endemic phase.\n' +
      'METHODS: A web-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted. DCE attributes reflected key NPIs implemented in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022, including mask wearing, dining restrictions, suspension of vocalization activities and large-scale events, quarantine after international travel, and mandatory vaccine boosters. Participants were recruited from a demographically representative online panel. Statistical analysis was performed using a mixed-logit model and mixed-mixed multinomial logit model.\n' +
      `RESULTS: A total of 1552 participants were included in the analysis. Overall preferences from the mixed-logit model showed that mask wearing was valued, both in public and indoors. Dining restrictions allowing groups of up to 5 people were preferred, but stricter dining restrictions allowing up to 2 people or no dining out were not favored. Prohibiting large-scale events was not preferred. Participants accepted quarantine at home but opposed quarantine in government facilities. Two classes emerged from the mixed-mixed logit model: class 1 ("Prefer NPIs") and class 2 ("Prefer No NPIs"). While class 1 (39%) was only opposed to a complete prohibition on dining in at food and beverage establishments, no NPIs were preferred by class 2 (61%). Both classes were not opposed to mandatory mask wearing, dining restrictions allowing groups of up to 5 people, and mandatory vaccine boosters. Sex, age, education, employment status, the number of COVID-19 vaccine shots received, and risk attitude were associated with individuals' likelihood of belonging to a specific preference group.\n` +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Following the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant after a prolonged period of restrictions, less disruptive NPIs such as mask wearing indoors were valued by the public and should be swiftly reinstated. Adaptive strategies should be adopted for more contentious NPIs, such as strict dining restrictions and quarantine policies. Public preferences should be considered in the design and selection of NPIs for future pandemic containment strategies to enhance compliance and effectiveness.',

    title: 'Quality of Care and Outcomes of Inpatients with COPD: A Multi-Center Study in China.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Hospitalization due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is linked to worse prognosis and increased healthcare burden, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of care and outcomes among inpatients with COPD and to identify prognostic factors relate to healthcare quality indicators.\n' +
      'METHODS: A multi-center, retrospective longitudinal study was conducted. Patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbations between January and December 2017 were randomly sampled from 16 secondary or tertiary public general hospitals in China. Healthcare quality process indicators and clinical outcomes were collected from medical records and patient questionnaires. The median follow-up period was 666 days. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for readmission or death within 30 days after discharge and for one-year mortality.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 891 inpatients with COPD were included. Among them, 14.3% underwent post-bronchodilator spirometry. Documentation of exacerbation history and symptom scores was found in 16.8% and 1.2% of medical records, respectively. Long-acting bronchodilators (LABDs) were prescribed at discharge in 30.3% of cases. Verbal counseling was the primary approach to smoking cessation education, rather than the 5A method. The 30-day readmission rate was 7.1%. The average exacerbation rate was 0.94 per patient during the following year, and the one-year mortality rate was 7.2%. Prescription of inhaled LABDs at discharge was significantly associated with a lower risk of readmission or death within 30 days (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.90, p=0.020). The presence of cardiovascular disease was associated with an increased risk of death within one year (HR 2.34, 95% CI 1.24-4.41, p=0.002).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The quality of inpatient care for COPD in China showed deficiencies in diagnostics, disease assessment, and patient education. Prescription of inhaled LABDs at discharge was a key quality measure that significantly reduced short-term readmission or mortality, highlighting its importance. Standardized protocols and clinician training are essential to improve patient outcomes.',

    title: 'Lessons Learned About the Education Needs of Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Mixed-Method Study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Much of the literature on kidney transplant education focuses on educating recipients prior to transplant or in the early postoperative period. It is unknown whether the information provided is meaningful to patients or whether the importance of education topics changes with time.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the learning needs of patients post-kidney transplant.\n' +
      'DESIGN: Our multidisciplinary team conducted a mixed-method study to better understand the learning needs of patients; what is important to them in the early postoperative period and a year after transplant.\n' +
      'SETTING: One urban academic hospital performing kidney transplant in Ontario, Canada. Data were collected between September 2019 and March 2021, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n' +
      "PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 20 participants in the post-kidney transplant clinic. Participants' mean age was 56 (SD ± 11) with 75% of participants male gender.\n" +
      'METHODS: Twenty kidney transplant patients were recruited between 3 and 6 months post-transplant. Participants completed an initial demographic questionnaire. They completed the Learning Needs Inventory (LNI) and a one-on-one semi-structured interview at 2 time points: 3 to 6 months post-transplant and 12 to 18 months post-transplant.\n' +
      `RESULTS: Patient interviews revealed that their access to a trustworthy health care team, support system, and reported challenges post-transplant shaped their ability to engage in learning. Patients shared that each aspect influences when and what topics were important to them, which allowed patients to obtain personalized education. A multidisciplinary team extending beyond physicians and nurses to include professionals such as pharmacists, dietitians, and social workers can best address patient-specific education needs post-transplant was highlighted in patients' comments. Patients revealed that their support system helps to develop self-reliance and support their transition after transplant to allow them to recover and manage challenges after transplant. Support systems varied from family, friends, colleagues and included social media and community organizations were helpful. Our study identified 3 realms of challenges post-transplant including: emotional, physical, and financial. Quantitative data showed significant findings on the level of importance regarding the use of alcohol, demonstrating a shift in median rating of "not important at all" to "not very important" ( = .016). A significant effect ( = .031) shifting the median rating of post-transplant dental care from of "a little important" to "very important."\n` +
      'LIMITATIONS: The small convenience sample with only English-speaking patients used in this study may have affected our ability for generalizable results. Part of this study was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have led to individual responses to vary, as priorities may have been different during the pandemic.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: Only 2 topics (dental care and use of alcohol) shifted in importance. Most education topics (ie, rejection, infection) covered in 3 to 6 months post-transplant continued to be important for those that have had their transplant for more than a year suggesting the need for ongoing education post-transplant. Multidisciplinary care teams play an important role in providing personalized education to patients and help to address emotional, physical, and financial challenges after transplant. This study showed the importance of social media and community organizations in patients' education offering an additional avenue of support and to hear others, lived experiences.\n" +

    title: 'Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment for Chronic Low Back Pain and Musculoskeletal Pain in Remote Underserved Populations: A Systematic Literature Review.',
    abstract: 'Chronic musculoskeletal pain, particularly chronic low back pain (CLBP), is a prevalent issue among rural populations, where limited access to healthcare exacerbates the condition and significantly impacts various aspects of daily life. The effects of chronic pain and healthcare barriers extend beyond physical health, influencing mental well-being, physical activity, and overall functionality as rural populations age. This complex healthcare challenge requires further investigation to identify effective, culturally relevant, and cost-efficient solutions. Proposed approaches include osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), telehealth, and alternative education models designed to incentivize healthcare professionals to serve these communities while respecting their cultural values and societal needs. Medical missions and volunteer healthcare efforts are already making strides in alleviating the impact of CLBP, which can lead to mental health decline, reduced mobility, and functional impairments. This systematic literature review synthesizes recent research on the effectiveness of OMT in managing chronic musculoskeletal pain, with a particular focus on low back pain (LBP) in underserved and rural populations. It examines how biopsychosocial factors and healthcare access influence treatment outcomes, while also proposing strategies for improving healthcare access through innovative education models and the use of technology. The review also considers the importance of community engagement and cultural sensitivity in these approaches. By analyzing research articles published between 2013 and 2023 from Google Scholar and PubMed, along with additional articles identified through a manual search of the  journal website, this review evaluates 26 relevant studies on the therapeutic benefits of OMT for CLBP. It aims to highlight the potential of OMT as an effective intervention for rural populations and to better understand the broader implications of chronic musculoskeletal pain on these communities.',

    title: 'Online Educational Intervention on Research Protocol Competencies in Medical Residents: A Quasi-experimental Study.',
    abstract: "Introduction Competence in research methodology and protocol development is essential for medical residents to integrate evidence-based medicine into clinical practice. Online Educational Interventions (OEIs) have been implemented as a structured approach to enhance these skills. This study assesses the impact of an OEI on research methodology knowledge and protocol development among first-year medical residents. Methods A quasi-experimental, prospective study was conducted from June 2022 to February 2023 at the Family Medicine Unit No. 1 of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) in Victoria, Mexico. First-year residents from multiple specialties participated in a structured OEI designed to strengthen competencies in research methodology. Pre- and post-intervention assessments were carried out using a custom-designed questionnaire validated through expert review. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank and paired Student's t-tests, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results A total of 101 medical residents were enrolled in the study, of whom 65 completed the intervention. Among the completers, 39 (60.0%) were female residents, and 26 (40.0%) were male residents. Family Medicine was the most represented specialty, comprising 29 participants (44.6%). Post-intervention assessments demonstrated statistically significant improvements across all evaluated domains (p < 0.05), with the most pronounced gains observed in data collection procedures, participant selection, and study design. The assessment tool showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84). Conclusions Structured OEIs significantly improve research methodology knowledge and protocol development skills in medical residents. These findings support their integration into residency training programs to strengthen research capacity and advance evidence-based practice.",

    title: 'The Diverse Experiences and Challenges of Individuals With Alopecia Areata: Survey Results From Finland.',
    abstract: 'Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic disease that significantly impacts well-being and quality of life. Despite its burden, professional support and treatment utilization remain low. This study investigated the experiences of 226 individuals in Finland with AA through an online survey. Most (82.7%) had at least one comorbid condition, most commonly atopic dermatitis (45.1%) and allergic rhinitis (43.4%). Depression and anxiety were reported by 22.1% and 23.0% of respondents, respectively. Those with ≥50% hair loss were significantly less likely to report higher overall well-being (odds ratio 0.60; 95% CI 0.38-0.96;  = .03), and experienced a greater negative impact on their relationships and social situations compared to those with <50% hair loss. The majority (82.7%) had not received any treatment for AA during the past year. Social media and peer support were the most common information sources. These findings highlight the need for improved patient education, and professional support. Healthcare providers should proactively offer guidance on treatment options and assess comorbidities to improve individual well-being.',
