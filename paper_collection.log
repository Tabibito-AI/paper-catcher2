    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. These instructional strategies aim to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a tool that can promote substantive student involvement and meaningful learning. (An initial draft of this abstract was produced by ChatGPT 4.0, but GenAI was not used in any other way for this article, other than as an interactive partner within the excerpts as clearly marked.)',

    title: 'Making Tens with Four Hands: Touchscreen-Based Classroom Activity for Early Number Learning',
    summary: 'As schools increasingly embrace embodied learning, there is a growing need to incorporate classroom teaching and learning activities that recognize the body’s role as both an individual and collective resource for cognition and instruction. In response, we present a design for a classroom teaching sequence focused on early number learning, featuring pedagogical activities supported by TouchCounts (TC) and engaged by pairs of children using their four hands. These activities showcase the potential of embodied learning for children to explore concepts such as odd and even numbers, as well as the composition and decomposition of numbers up to and including ten. We elaborate on the functionalities of TC, outline the teaching sequence, and offer episodes of our classroom observations. Specifically, we present three lesson snapshots aimed at first-graders (aged 6 to 7) using a class set of TC, student learning outcomes, and notable observations as students interact with the touchscreen environment. For example, we note that the student pairs used their hands to reinforce, extend, and redirect mathematical ideas; besides, they developed a collective discourse through (gestural) subitizing the number of fingers that they (and their partner) put up (and folded down). This snapshot explicates the collective learning experiences in classroom settings involving pair-work activities and informs existing work on embodied (mathematical) cognition beyond how students learn with their bodies individually.',

    summary: 'In this article, we investigate the effects of the app Fingu on a child’s understanding of the part-whole concept. Using the Artifact Centric Activity Theory framework, we initially analyse the internalisation and externalisation processes that appear to occur during one child’s use of the app. Based on the learning from this process, we then use other aspects of the framework, in particular the subject-artifact-group triangle, to understand how Fingu might be used productively in mathematics education classrooms. Using a 13-min video of a child playing Fingu as our data source, we analyse how children might, as they learn about part-whole relationships, interact with the game. We also investigate how design principles in creating apps can impact on the experience of using the app in ways that may be unintended by their designers. This work has implications for app designers and for mathematics educators seeking to incorporate digital technologies into mathematics education.',

    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Literacy and Financial Education: Private Providers, Public Certification and Political Preferences',
    summary: 'Financial education can influence the level of financial literacy. In many countries public authorities implement financial education policy by means of ex ante certification of both private and public providers of education activities. This article uses political economy, educational marketing and text analysis as complementary tools to offer a positive analysis of such setting. Being financial education a credence good and given the key assumption that financial literacy is a country state–contingent endowment that deteriorates, as a consequence of innovation, the third-party certification can be considered as a strategic governance solution. Yet, when a public agency acts as third-party certifier, political and bureaucratic incentives shape its action. In particular, political activism in financial education can be motivated by financial instability worries. Such theoretical relationship is empirically confirmed applying text analyses, and using financial education narrative as a proxy for activism both for the politicians of the European Parliament and the bureaucrats of the ECB in the period 1997–2024.',

    summary: "This study is a critical review of public intervention and its management of change with digitalization, applied to Spanish tourism services, as ones of the largest case and most required of attention into the European Union. In comparison with other mainstream papers, this heterodox review is based on the combination of Austrian Economics and Neo-Institutional approaches ( Cornucopists ), with their common theoretical and methodological frameworks. Thus, it is possible to analyze failures and paradoxes in the public intervention, especially with post-COVID recovery policies. The case of the Spanish tourism sector highlights the effect of double bureaucracy, from European institutions and the Spanish Government, affecting its competitiveness and revealing the confirmation of heterodox theorems. Faced with mainstream public intervention guidelines, which usually involve expansive spending and more debt (and New-Malthusian measures), a heterodox mainline solution is offered here, based on the revival of the original sustainability principle, the readjustment effect and the promotion of geek'n'talent education, to facilitate the transition to the Knowledge Economy, where the tourism sector is capable of offering personalized travel experiences due to digitalization.",

The method of this study was to divide 587 GDM patients admitted to Lishui Maternal and Child Health Hospital from May 2020 to June 2023 into training group (n = 410) and test group (n = 177) by using R 4.3.2 in a ratio of 7:3. The training set cases were divided into target group (n = 109) and non-target group (n = 301) according to whether SMBG was met (monitoring fasting or postprandial 2 h blood glucose 2-4 times per week).Key factors affecting SMBG were identified through univariate analysis and logistic regression, including education level, family income, glucometer possession, and dimensions of the Information-Motivation-Behavior (IMB) model. A nomogram prediction model was developed, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.863 and 0.829 in the training and testing cohorts, respectively, demonstrating good predictive performance. The calibration curve confirmed the accuracy of the model. The findings suggest that SMBG behavior in GDM patients is influenced by socioeconomic and psychological factors, and the developed model provides a valuable tool for clinical assessment and intervention.',

    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To identify the contextual factors associated with the clinical use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional national exploratory survey was carried out in Brazil. The questionnaire Personal and environmental barriers for the implementation of the ICF by physical therapists was mailed to physical and occupational therapists. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore associations between contextual factors with education, attitudes, beliefs, interest, and perception related to work resources.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The overall response rate was 70% ( = 604). Most respondents showed interest to incorporate ICF in the clinical practice (98%), believe that ICF is essential to clinical practice (93%), and facilitate communication (91%). The most cited barrier was difficulty in applying the ICF for assessments of patients. Four characteristics (access to ICF outside the work environment, supportive actions, sex and academic education) explained 11% of the variance associated with attitudes, beliefs and interests for the use of the ICF. Two characteristics (age and access to ICF at work) explained 7% of the variance associated with education for the use of ICF. Two characteristics (working in education institutions and working in urban regions) explained 10% of the variance associated with the perception of support and availability of resources for the ICF use.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Physical and occupational therapists have positive attitudes toward the use of ICF, but most respondents did not receive satisfactory academic training and reported low self-efficacy for using ICF in clinical practice.',

    title: 'Effect of educational intervention on quality of life in diabetic patients: a comparison between intervention and control groups at Ziaeian hospital.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Diabetes increases healthcare load and seriously compromises quality of life. This study aimed to develop a hospital-based educational and follow-up strategy at Ziaeian Hospital and assess how it affected the diabetic patients' health outcomes.\n" +
      "METHODS: This study was a community-level intervention based on Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT). The study was conducted from 2020 to 2022 at Ziaeian Hospital in District 17 of Tehran, involving 312 diabetic patients. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups: the intervention group ( = 156) and the control group ( = 156). The intervention group received structured education, continuous follow-up, and family engagement, while the control group underwent standard treatment. Data were collected using a researcher-developed questionnaire and the SF-36 quality of life assessment. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 14.02, with significance set at  < 0.05. The statistical tests employed included t-tests, Chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact test, and paired t-test.\n" +
      'RESULT: The mortality rate in the control group was therefore 9.03%, higher than the 5.52% noted in the intervention group. Baseline clinical markers (FBS, HbA1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, and BMI) showed no appreciable differences across the groups. Though no significant changes in social functioning, mental health, or physical performance, the intervention group showed notable improvements in overall quality of life ( = 0.0053), general health ( < 0.0001), energy/fatigue ( < 0.0001).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: In conclusion, systematic instruction and continuous monitoring improved quality of life and lower mortality among diabetics. These results highlight the need of patient monitoring in diabetes management as well as of hospital-based training programs.',

    title: 'Prison connectivity and disease transmission to neighboring communities: The role of prison staff.',
    abstract: 'Using smartphone location data and a novel application of publicly available employment data, we map how California communities are connected to nearby prisons through the movement of prison staff, and we measure the role these connections play in spreading infectious diseases. Leveraging an exogenous prisoner transfer-induced COVID-19 outbreak at San Quentin state prison in June 2020 as a quasiexperiment, we examine the unidirectional spread of the disease from the prison to surrounding communities. This outbreak was unique: its origin from outside Northern California was clearly documented and nonstaff entry and exit was severely limited during this time. Our identification strategy compares zip codes connected and unconnected to the prison via staff movement. Compared to unconnected zip codes with similar pretransfer COVID-19 rates and demographic characteristics (race/ethnicity, education, household income, age, and population), zip codes connected to San Quentin had 13% more new COVID-19 cases in July and 30% more in August. Our results suggest that a hypothetical novel infectious disease that emerged in California prisons could lead to almost 15,000 community infections within 1 month from staff movements alone. These findings identify the degree to which "closed institutions" are-even during lockdowns-epidemiologically porous, highlighting the need for public health interventions to reduce the unintended consequences of such connections on the spread of infectious disease.',

In recent years, Cross-reality (XR) has emerged as a viable path for immersive and successful training experiences. This paper presents preliminary results from the SCISSOR project, a groundbreaking initiative exploring the potential of XR technologies in enhancing OHS training, especially in healthcare setting regarding ionization radiation exposure.\n' +
      'MATERIALS AND METHODS: This quasi-experimental pilot study consisted of several stages from July 2021 to June 2022. Phase 1 consists of the realization of the virtual scenario, Phase 2 in XR setting up and laboratory simulation, and lastly, and Phase 3 based on the on field testing.\n' +
      'RESULTS: About 60 participants, including students and researchers, participated in Phases 1 and 2 preliminary testing and 9 healthcare workers (HCWs) in Phase 3. Phase 1 involved the 3D reconstruction of a real-life scenario using digital photogrammetry. These models were then utilized to recreate the operating room scenario and program interactions with the equipment. In Phase 2, the overall appreciation for the level of realism, comfort, and usability of the application was investigated. The test results demonstrated a general appreciation for the application and its effectiveness. Phase 3, concerning field tests, involved HCWs. The results suggest that XR technologies hold significant promise in revolutionizing OHS training, offering a more engaging, effective, and adaptable approach to workplace safety education.\n' +

    title: 'Moderating Effect of Psychosocial Safety Climate on the Association of Job Demands and Job Resources With Psychological Distress Among Japanese Employees: A Cross-sectional Study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: We examined the moderating (buffering or amplifying) effect of psychosocial safety climate (PSC) on the association of job demands (psychological demands) and job resources (job control, supervisor support, coworker support, and extrinsic reward) with psychological distress among Japanese employees.\n' +
      "METHODS: A self-report web-based questionnaire was administered to 2,200 employees (1,100 men and 1,100 women) registered with a Japanese private online survey company. The questionnaire included scales on job demands and job resources (the Job Content Questionnaire and the short-form Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire), PSC (the 12-item PSC scale), and psychological distress (the K6 scale) and items on participants' demographic and occupational characteristics (age, gender, education, occupation, work form, and working hours per week). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed using psychological distress as a dependent variable. Interaction terms of job demands and job resources with PSC were included.\n" +
      'RESULTS: There was a significant interaction effect of psychological demands with PSC on psychological distress ( = -0.053,  = 0.008), adjusted for demographic and occupational characteristics.  simple slope analysis showed that the simple slope of psychological demands was lesser at higher levels of PSC (1 standard deviation above the mean) ( = 0.101,  < 0.001) than at lower levels (1 standard deviation below the mean) ( = 0.199,  < 0.001).

    title: "Obstetricians' experiences with remote monitoring programs for hypertensive disorders.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Despite widespread use in primary care, remote patient monitoring (RPM) in obstetrics for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy remain limited. Little is known about the specific modalities, perceived impact, and integration of RPM into standard practice in obstetrics.\n' +
      "OBJECTIVE: To explore obstetricians' experiences with RPM for hypertensive disorders in the perinatal period and barriers in implementation, and to identify promising practices to overcome these barriers.\n" +
      'STUDY DESIGN: This qualitative study, conducted from September to October 2024, involved semi-structured interviews with 20 obstetricians across the United States, who represented different practice settings and RPM program models. We developed a qualitative codebook and conducted thematic analysis informed by the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Five key themes emerged from interviews: (1) Barriers to Engagement; (2) Perceptions of Clinical Benefit; (3) Financial Hurdles in RPM Utilization; (4) Navigating Workflow and Data Challenges; and (5) Liability Concerns in RPM. RPM programs varied substantially in their eligibility criteria, timing within the perinatal period, data transfer methods, staffing models, and workflow. The major barriers included financial constraints (eg, insurance coverage and equipment costs), complex workflows, liability concerns related to 24/7 monitoring and response, and patient-level barriers (eg, technology literacy, language, and anxiety). Obstetricians used several strategies to overcome these challenges, including having patients bring their cuffs to the office to validate accuracy, assigning dedicated staff or partnering with a vendor to streamline workflows, coupling RPM with additional services like pregnancy education to improve adherence, and training staff so not all issues (eg, medication titration) require escalation to obstetricians. Despite the challenges, participants generally valued RPM and observed benefits in both clinical outcomes and patient engagement.\n' +

    title: "Obstetric violence informed by theories of intersectionality, oppression, and power dynamics-a Ghanaian's perspectives.",
    abstract: "This essay explores obstetric violence (OV) from a Ghanaian perspective, applying theories of intersectionality, oppression, and power dynamics to critically analyze its causes and manifestations. OV, defined as mistreatment during childbirth, includes acts of physical abuse, nonconsensual care, discrimination, and breaches of privacy. Despite efforts to reduce maternal mortality in Ghana, systemic challenges persist, contributing to a high prevalence of OV, particularly among vulnerable groups such as adolescents, the socioeconomically disadvantaged, and ethnic minorities. The essay highlights that midwives, while essential to maternal care, often operate within oppressive healthcare systems characterized by poor resourcing, rigid hierarchies, and systemic gender bias. Through the lens of intersectionality, the study reveals how overlapping social identities-such as age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status-influence women's vulnerability to mistreatment. Oppressed group theory explains how midwives, themselves marginalized within patriarchal and medically dominated structures, may internalize oppression and perpetuate violence toward patients. Foucault's theory of power and knowledge is used to illustrate how institutional norms and knowledge hierarchies empower midwives to exercise control over birthing women, often compromising women's autonomy and dignity. The essay further discusses how systemic issues, including underinvestment in healthcare infrastructure, inadequate training on respectful maternity care, and normalization of abusive practices, contribute to the persistence of OV. It calls for comprehensive reforms such as empowering midwives through education and leadership training, decentralizing healthcare authority, promoting respectful maternity care practices, and addressing systemic inequities. Raising awareness, fostering accountability, and embedding patient-centered care principles into healthcare institutions are critical steps toward eliminating OV. Ultimately, the essay argues that addressing OV in Ghana requires not only confronting individual behaviors but dismantling the deeper structural and institutional forces that sustain power imbalances and systemic oppression. Empowering both midwives and birthing women is essential for transforming maternity care and advancing equitable, respectful maternal health outcomes in Ghana.",
