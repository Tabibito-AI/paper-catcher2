    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Economics of education',
    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'The Effectiveness of 3D Virtual Environments for BPMN Teaching: A Quasi-Experimental Study',
    summary: 'Traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams, being static and highly abstract, often hinder comprehension, particularly for novice designers and students. This can lead to misinterpretations and process inefficiencies. In this study, we investigate whether immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments can enhance the understanding of BPMN models. We developed a virtual reality (VR)-based BPMN visualization tool and conducted a quasi -experiment with 48 academic and professional participants, who interacted with a 3D BPMN model using Google Cardboard and a joystick. Participants completed comprehension tasks before and after the VR experience. The results show significant improvements in understanding and engagement, suggesting that immersive virtual reality can be a valuable educational tool for BPMN learning. This study contributes empirical evidence supporting the integration of 3D environments in process modeling education, offering benefits for both academic and professional training.',

    title: 'Tech-Enhanced Learning: Evaluating General Education in Vocational Colleges Through Technology Integration',
    summary: 'In vocational education, the role of general education (GE) is pivotal in cultivating a well-rounded skill set among students. As the demands of the job market evolve, it becomes imperative to assess and enhance the efficacy of GE in these specialized settings. Vocational colleges (VC) and higher vocational institutions are essential in getting pupils ready for careers by offering specialized courses. However, the significance of GE cannot be overstated, as it provides a foundation for critical thinking, communication skills, and a broad intellectual perspective. This investigation aims to investigate the evaluation system of GE and related courses within VCs and higher vocational institutions. The study employs a descriptive mixed-methods approach. A purposive sampling technique was utilized to select participants. Using a questionnaire survey and interview method, the data for this paper was gathered from 157 teachers and 208 students. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS for statistical analysis. The findings identified that integrating technology-based evaluation methods enhances the effectiveness of GE programs in VCs. The result clarified that regular feedback and assessment in GE courses in higher VCs lead to better retention and understanding of the course content. The novelty of the study lies in assessing GE and courses in vocational and higher VCs, by exploring unique evaluation systems, it aims to enhance the quality of education, aligning curriculum with industry demands, and promoting well-rounded graduates in vocational settings.',

    title: 'Assessing the role of artificial intelligence in quality of legal education with special reference to sustainable development goal',
    summary: 'The transformational potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly apparent in a variety of fields, including legal education. This study investigates the potential of AI in transforming legal education in order to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs), 2030. As nations and cultures global struggle to achieve the SDGs, legal professionals play an important role in establishing legal frameworks that support progress toward these goals. It can improve the delivery of legal curricula by providing customized learning experiences targeted to individuals. AI can also help educators to create current content and enhance the evaluation. Education is now more dynamic, accessible, and affordable, expanding its reach. Quality of legal education is a cornerstone of achieving the SDGs set for 2030. The effective utilization of AI in the field of legal education holds significant promise in not only expanding access but also improving the quality of legal education. AI-powered legal research tools have the potential to revolutionize legal research for law students, researchers, and legal practitioners. They can provide more efficient and comprehensive ways to explore legal precedents, case law, and statutes, thus empowering legal professionals to perform their duties with greater accuracy and efficiency. By improving access to legal information, these tools can play a significant role in the formulation of laws and regulations that align with the SDGs. This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which AI can contribute to advancing legal education and, consequently, supporting the attainment of the SDGs.',

    title: 'Die Konzeption von Erfolg aus Sicht von Absolvent:innen mit Beeinträchtigung: Schlüsselaspekte der Inklusion in der deutschen Hochschulbildung',
    summary: 'Während sich in den letzten Jahren verschiedene Wissenschaftler:innen mit der Inklusion und dem Bildungserfolg von Menschen mit Beeinträchtigungen auseinandergesetzt haben, bleibt die Frage, was diese selbst unter Studienerfolg verstehen, weitgehend außer Acht. Das erste Ziel dieses Artikels ist es, die Konzeptionen von Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Schlüsselfaktoren zu analysieren, die zum Hochschulerfolg von 28 Absolvent:innen mit Beeinträchtigung aus 16 deutschen Hochschulen beigetragen haben. Das zweite Ziel besteht darin, Empfehlungen zu geben, die die Teilnehmenden selbst an andere Studierende mit Beeinträchtigung sowie an die Hochschulen richten, um ihren Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung zu verbessern. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Teilnehmenden unterschiedliche Konzeptionen von Erfolg haben (Erreichen eines Abschlusses, gute Noten, Erlernen und Entwickeln von Fähigkeiten, Sammeln von praktischen Erfahrungen, Überwinden von Herausforderungen und Aufrechterhalten eines Gleichgewichts zwischen Studium und Gesundheit) sowie verschiedene persönliche Faktoren (die Behinderung als treibende Kraft) und kontextuelle Faktoren (soziales und familiäres Umfeld, Auslandsaufenthalte, positives Feedback, Anerkennung von Leistungen und zugängliche Online-Kurse und digitalisierte Materialien) als relevant für ihren Erfolg identifizierten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen ferner, dass es für den Erfolg in der Hochschulbildung und die Stärkung von Studierenden mit Beeinträchtigung entscheidend ist, die Stimmen von Absolvent:innen mit Behinderung zu hören. While various researchers have explored inclusion and the educational success of people with impairments in recent years, the question of what the latter mean by academic success remains understudied. The first aim of this article is to analyse the conceptualisations of success in higher education and the key factors that contributed to the academic success of 28 graduates with impairments from 16 German universities. The second aim is to provide recommendations from the participants themselves to other students with impairments and to higher education institutions for improving their success in higher education. The results show that the participants have different conceptualisations of success (achieving a degree, getting good grades, learning and developing skills, gaining practical experience, overcoming challenges and maintaining a balance between studies and health) and identified various personal factors (the disability as a driving force) and contextual factors (social and family environment, time abroad, positive feedback, recognition of achievements and accessible online courses and digitised materials), as relevant to their success. The findings further demonstrate that hearing the voices of graduates with impairments is critical to their success in higher education and the empowerment of students with disabilities.',

    title: 'Supplementation Matters: Academic Impact of an Afterschool Tutoring Program in Timor-Leste',
    summary: 'Students in Timor-Leste face low educational outcomes due to sociopolitical factors rooted in the nation’s colonial history. This study evaluates the academic impact of a low-resource afterschool supplementary tutoring program designed to address learning gaps and improve school outcomes across rural and urban settings. Using instructional design principles, the program employed worksheet-based individualized learning content in a familiar language, supported by personalized feedback. Pre- and post-test scores in mathematics and English were compared over 7 months between an intervention group and a comparison group, with results analyzed using a Welch t test. Findings revealed statistically significant improvements in both subjects, with greater gains in mathematics, suggesting an opportunity to explore alternative methods for English instruction, such as incorporating social interactions to support early learners. The study highlights the importance of community support, tutors’ capabilities, and their residence within local neighborhoods in sustaining the program. These results demonstrate the potential of well-structured afterschool programs to enhance educational outcomes in low-resource contexts, offering a scalable model for similar initiatives in emerging nations.',

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. These instructional strategies aim to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a tool that can promote substantive student involvement and meaningful learning. (An initial draft of this abstract was produced by ChatGPT 4.0, but GenAI was not used in any other way for this article, other than as an interactive partner within the excerpts as clearly marked.)',

    title: 'Informationssuchverhalten und digitale Gesundheitskompetenz von Schüler*innen in Deutschland während der Coronapandemie',
    summary: 'Hintergrund Während der Coronapandemie waren Schüler*innen mit einer Flut von Informationen zur Gesundheit und zur Coronapandemie konfrontiert. Der adäquate Umgang mit Gesundheitsinformationen setzt (digitale) Gesundheitskompetenz voraus. Ziel des Beitrags ist daher, das Informationssuchverhalten und das Ausmaß der digitalen Gesundheitskompetenz (dGK) von Schüler*innen in Deutschland während der Coronapandemie unter Berücksichtigung ihres sozialen Hintergrunds zu analysieren. Material und Methoden Die Online-Befragung wurde während des dritten Lockdowns, von März bis Juli 2021, in Hessen und anderen Bundesländern durchgeführt. Der Feldzugang erfolgte in weiterführenden Schulen, Verbänden und Sportvereinen. Der Online-Fragebogen wurde von N  = 1096 Schüler*innen der Klassenstufe 6 bis 13 aufgerufen und n  = 361 Schüler*innen vollständig ausgefüllt. Es wurden das gesundheitsbezogene Informationssuchverhalten (internetbasierte Quellen für Gesundheitsinformationen, [digitale] Quellen für Informationen zur Coronapandemie), die dGK (Digital Health Literacy Instrument [DHLI]) sowie soziodemografische und -ökonomische Hintergrundmerkmale (Geschlecht, Alter, zuhause gesprochene Sprache, Schulform, subjektiver Sozialstatus) erfasst und mittels uni-, bi- und multivariater Analysen mit SPSS ausgewertet. Ergebnisse Nach Gesundheitsinformationen zum Coronavirus im Internet suchten regelmäßig 75,6 % der Schüler*innen. Schwierigkeiten beim Umgang mit digitalen Gesundheitsinformationen gaben 52,6 % der Schüler*innen an. 49,8 % der Schüler*innen berichteten von Schwierigkeiten beim Bewerten der Zuverlässigkeit von digitalen Informationen zum Coronavirus. Die bi- und multivariaten Analysen weisen darauf hin, dass sich die dGK nach dem subjektiven Sozialstatus (SSS) dahingehend unterscheidet, dass Schüler*innen mit niedrigem bzw. mittlerem SSS (OR = 2,57, 95 %-KI: 1,30–5,06, p  = 0,006) häufiger Schwierigkeiten im Umgang mit digitalen Gesundheitsinformationen zur Coronapandemie aufweisen als Gleichaltrige der Vergleichsgruppen. Die dGK unterscheidet sich nicht signifikant nach soziodemografischen (Geschlecht, Migrationshintergrund) und weiteren sozialen Merkmalen (besuchte Schulform, familiärer Wohlstand). Schlussfolgerung Die Förderung der dGK von Schüler*innen auf Schul- und Individualebene stellt ein wichtiges Anliegen der Prävention und Gesundheitsförderung dar. Durch bildungspolitische Maßnahmen (z. B. durch den „Medienkompetenzrahmen“ für die schulischen Medienbildung in den Bundesländern) sollte es den Schulen ermöglicht werden, die (d)GK im Rahmen der Medien- und Gesundheitsbildung in den Unterricht, Curricula und auf allen Ebenen von und bei allen Akteuren in Schulen (bspw. durch die organisationale Gesundheitskompetenz) zu berücksichtigen. Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, schoolchildren were confronted with a flood of information on health and the coronavirus. Adequate handling of health information requires (digital) health literacy (dHL). The aim of this article is therefore to analyse the information-seeking behaviour and the extent of dHL of schoolchildren in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic according to their social background. Materials and methods The online survey was conducted during the third lockdown, from March–July 2021, in Hesse and other German federal states. Students in secondary schools, associations and sports clubs were contacted. The online questionnaire was accessed by N  = 1096 schoolchildren in grades 6–13 and n  = 361 schoolchildren completed it in full. Health-related information-seeking behaviour (internet-based sources for health information, [digital] sources for information on the COVID-19 pandemic), dHL (Digital Health Literacy Instrument [DHLI]) as well as sociodemographic and socioeconomic background characteristics (gender, age, language spoken at home, type of school, subjective social status) were recorded and evaluated using uni-, bi- and multivariate analyses with SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Results In all, 75.6% of schoolchildren regularly searched for digital health information about the coronavirus. 52.6% of the schoolchildren reported difficulties in dealing with digital health information. 49.8% of the schoolchildren reported difficulties in assessing the reliability of digital information on the coronavirus. The bi- and multivariate analyses indicated that the dHL differs according to subjective social status (SSS) in that those students with low or medium SSS (odds ratio = 2.57, 95% confidence interval 1.30–5.06, p  = 0.006) more frequently have difficulties in dealing with digital health information on the COVID-19 pandemic than their peers in the comparison groups. The dHL did not differ significantly according to sociodemographic (gender, migration background) and other social characteristics (type of school attended, family wealth). Conclusion Promotion of (d)HL among schoolchildren at school and individual level is an important issue for prevention and health promotion. Educational policy measures (e.g. in the form of “media literacy frameworks” for school media education in the federal states) should enable schools to take (d)HL into account in the context of media and health education in lessons, curricula and at all levels of and among all actors in schools (e.g. through organisational health literacy).',

    title: 'Context Matters: Exploring the Structural Relationships Between ICT Usage, Support, Perceived Usefulness, Intention to Use, and Learning Motivation',
    summary: 'Previous research has extensively explored the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in education. However, much of previous research has not differentiated between the environments where ICT is used, particularly in terms of its perceived usefulness in school versus at home. This gap in understanding the contextual influence of ICT on students’ learning motivation forms the basis for this study. In particular, this research aims to clarify how different environments influence the effectiveness of ICT in motivating students. Using data from 737 high school students, collected through two surveys, and employing Structural Equation Modeling, the study found that ICT usage in schools is positively linked to its perceived usefulness in both school and home environments. Additionally, ICT support from teachers enhances the perceived usefulness of ICT in both contexts. Furthermore, the perceived usefulness of ICT in both school and home environments significantly predicts students’ intentions to use ICT. However, only the perceived usefulness of ICT at home significantly predicts learning motivation, contrary to initial expectations that school-related ICT would also be a significant predictor. These findings suggest that enhancing students’ learning motivation through ICT integration may require more emphasis on the home environment. The implications for educational policy and practice are discussed, emphasizing a more efficient strategy in incorporating ICT into education.',

    title: 'Lehrer:innen als Influencer:innen',
    summary: 'Lehrpersonen, die soziale Medien zu beruflichen Zwecken verwenden und viele Follower:innen haben, werden auch als Bildungsinfluencer:innen bezeichnet. Influencer:innen gelten als einflussreiche Personen, die meist private Einblicke mit gesponsortem Produktmarketing verbinden. Bislang liegen im internationalen Vergleich für Deutschland jedoch wenige empirische Befunde zum Phänomen ‚Lehrer:innen als Influencer:innen‘ vor. Daher ist z. B. noch nicht ausreichend erforscht, wie sie sich selbst in den sozialen Netzwerken präsentieren und ob sie private Einblicke mit Produktmarketing verbinden. Im Beitrag werden 42 Profilbeschreibungen sowie verlinkte Webseiten von Lehrpersonen auf Instagram analysiert. Die von den Lehrkräften frei gestaltbaren, prominent im Feed platzierten Profilbeschreibungen werden dazu genutzt, sich selbst und das Profil in wenigen Worten zu präsentieren, sodass den Profilbeschreibungen eine relevante (selbst-)darstellerische Funktion zugesprochen werden kann. Mit einem inhaltlich-strukturierenden qualitativ-inhaltsanalytischen Vorgehen kann gezeigt werden, wie und mit welchen Themen sich die Lehrer:innen darstellen, aber auch, welche Produkte bzw. Leistungen sie zum käuflichen Erwerb anbieten. Die Befunde zeigen, dass die Lehrkräfte sich überwiegend als engagierte und multitaskingfähige Lehrer:innen, die zusätzliche Rollen (z. B. Autor:in) einnehmen, präsentieren und Produkte/Leistung zum Kauf anbieten, die dem Lehrberuf mittel- oder unmittelbar nahestehen, wie z. B. Lern- und/oder Unterrichtsmaterialien. Die Aktivitäten der Bildungsinfluencer:innen werden vor dem Hintergrund des „unternehmerischen Selbst“ (Bröckling 2019 ) als neue Form der Ökonomisierung der Bildung gedeutet, in der die Lehrpersonen als autonome Entrepreneur:innen agieren. Teachers who use social media for professional purposes and have many followers are also referred to as Education(al)-Influencers. Influencers are regarded as influential people who often combine private insights with sponsored service or product marketing. To date, in an international comparison, there have been few empirical findings on the phenomenon of “teachers as influencers” in Germany. For example, there is still insufficient research into how they present themselves on social networks and whether they combine private insights with service and/or product marketing. The article analyses 42 profile descriptions and linked websites of teachers on Instagram. The prominently placed profile description, which can be freely designed by the teachers, are used to present themselves and their profile in a few words, so that the profile descriptions can be attributed a relevant (self-)representational function. A content-structuring qualitative content analysis can be used to show how teachers present themselves, about which topics they post about and which products and/or services they offer for sale. The findings show that teachers predominantly present themselves as committed and multitasking teachers who take on additional roles (e.g. author) and offer products and/or services for sale that are directly or indirectly related to the teaching profession, such as learning and/or teaching materials. Against the background of the “unternehmerischen Selbst” (engl. entrepreneurial self ) (Bröckling 2019 ) the activities of educational influencers are interpreted as a new form of economization of education in which teachers act as independent entrepreneurs.',

    title: 'Gibt es einen Inter*-Neglect?',
    summary: 'Geschlechtlichkeit umfasst unterschiedliche Ebenen, darunter auch das Körpergeschlecht, welches traditionell in männlich und weiblich codiert wird. Varianten der Geschlechtsentwicklung werden zumeist unter den Begriff Intergeschlechtlichkeit (kurz: Inter*) subsummiert. Die Aufklärung zu Inter* gehört in verschiedene Bereiche der Bildung und Erziehung, die oft durch Pädagog*innen ausgeübt werden, aber auch (ergänzend) durch Informationsmaterialien geschehen kann. Auf Basis einer kriteriengeleiteten Auswahl von kostenfreien Informationsmaterialien bundesweiter Akteur*innen zu geschlechtlicher Vielfalt wurde der Stellenwert von Inter* mittels einer quantitativen Inhaltsanalyse untersucht. Basierend auf N  = 32 Informationsmaterialien zeigte sich, dass Inter* sehr oft benannt wird, Inter*-bezogene im Vergleich zu Trans*(geschlechtlichkeits)-bezogenen Begriffen jedoch seltener vorkamen. Außerdem wurden Varianzen des Körpergeschlechts im Vergleich zur Geschlechtsidentität deutlich seltener thematisiert. Insgesamt konnte ein relativer Inter*-Neglect, also eine relative Vernachlässigung bzw. Dethematisierung von Inter* zugunsten der Fokussierung auf Geschlechtsidentitäten, konstatiert werden. Gender encompasses different levels, including sex, which is traditionally categorised as male and female. Differences of sex development are usually subsumed under the term intersex (short: inter*). Education about inter* belongs is part of various areas of education, which is provided by educational professionals, but can also be (additionally) realised through information materials. Based on a criteria-led selection of free information materials on sex and gender diversity from nationwide stakeholders, the relevance of inter* was analysed using a deductive quantitative content analysis. Based on N  = 32 information materials, it was found that inter* is mentioned very often, but inter*-related terms occur less frequently than trans*(gender)-related terms. In addition, it was found that variations in sex are addressed much less frequently in the information materials compared to gender identity. Overall, a relative inter* neglect, a relative omission or demthematization of inter* in favour of a focus on gender identities, can be observed.',

    title: "3D prototyped macro-models as educational aid for teaching endodontic access in preclinical training: Assessment of students' learning experience, confidence and performance.",
    abstract: 'AIM: This study evaluated the effectiveness of three-dimensional prototyped macro-models (3DPMM) as an educational aid for teaching endodontic access to dental students.\n' +
      'METHODOLOGY: A total of 72 students were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 24) and participated in study sessions with 3DPMM at different stages: before, during (intermediate) or after performing laboratory projects. The timing of the 3DPMM study sessions rotated across groups for different tooth types (anterior, premolar and molar). Each student performed endodontic access on nine teeth (four anterior, three premolars and two molars). Students completed a questionnaire evaluating their learning experience and confidence. Endodontic access projects were graded by masked instructors, and the data were statistically analysed (α = 0.05).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Students rated their learning experience with the 3DPMM positively, regardless of their differences based on group assignment, tooth type or timing of the study session (p > .05). Procedural errors were observed in 47% of the teeth, with 35.6% exhibiting one error and 11.4% exhibiting two errors. The most common errors included gouging (26.6%) and oversized access cavities (23.5%). Students who completed endodontic access before using the 3DPMM had a significantly higher frequency of multiple errors, oversized access cavities and retained pulp chamber roof (p < .05). Approximately 60% of participants reported increased confidence after using the models, regardless of group assignment, tooth type or study session timing (p > .05).\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that integrating 3DPMM enhanced students' understanding of internal tooth anatomy, increased their confidence and reduced procedural errors. Students appreciated the hands-on, interactive learning experience offered by the models, reinforcing the value of innovative educational tools in endodontic training.",

    title: 'Multi-strategy instructional intervention for healthy eating intention among school going adolescents: a quasi-experimental study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a distinct stage of life characterized by significant physical, psychological, and cognitive development. Maintaining healthy eating behaviors during this period is crucial for preventing various forms of malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. This study aimed to assess the effects of educational interventions based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) on improving the healthy eating intention of adolescents in selected schools in Bardiya District.\n' +
      'METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was conducted among eighth and ninth graders aged between 12 and 18 years from two public schools in Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality of Nepal, one as an intervention (IG) and the other as a control group (CG), selected randomly. A total of 167 students participated in the study, with 82 in the IG and 85 in the CG. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires at baseline and4 weeks after the intervention. The intervention package consisted of an interactive lecture, a group discussion, a poster, an educational video, and a song. In contrast, the control group followed the regular school curriculum without any additional nutrition education. The educational intervention for the IG consisted of 6 sessions, each lasting 60 min. Data were entered and analyzed in SPSS V22, using a chi-square test, paired t-test, and linear regression.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The educational intervention led to significant improvements in knowledge and TPB constructs, with these changes being statistically significant (p < 0.001). The adjusted mean score increases in TPB constructs because the interaction of time and intervention increased from 0.47 to 5.49. The highest gain (β = 5.49; p = 0.001) was observed in the perceived behavioural control score whereas, a minor improvement was seen in behaviour (β = 0.47; p = 0.112). After the intervention, a net increase in the healthy eating intention score was 14.8% compared with that of the control group.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that multipronged educational intervention may be effective in improving adolescents' healthy eating intentions, mainly through perceived eating control and attitude. Model-based and construct-oriented health education can be used with caution in schools to promote healthy eating intentions.",

    title: 'The health-related quality of life of Brazilians with epidermolysis bullosa.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) presents various complications that can affect an individual's health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and nutritional status. This cross-sectional study evaluates HRQoL and its association with the socio-demographic, nutritional, and clinical profiles of Brazilians with EB.\n" +
      "RESULTS: The sample consisted of 129 individuals (median age: 15 years), approximately 57% female, mostly composed of the EB simplex clinical type, followed by the dystrophic EB type (DEB). The mean score on the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire was 11.01 [standard deviation (SD) = 7.31], with a moderate impact on HRQoL. The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the score obtained in the Quality of Life Evaluation in Epidermolysis Bullosa- Brazilian Portuguese questionnaire was 13 (IQR: 8-19), which also indicated a moderate impact on HRQoL. In the subgroup aged ≥ 17 years, schooling positively influenced HRQoL, and decreased HRQoL was directly associated with underweight nutritional status. Family income promoted HRQoL in both subgroups.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL assessment showed that the DEB type was associated with the most severe effect. Additionally, the large impact, in < 17 years, was associated with family income, but did not present an association with nutritional status. While the severe impact on HRQoL, in ≥ 17 years, presented an association with nutritional status, family income, and education. Future research is important, to understand this population's needs, provide adequate care, and promote the best HRQoL.",

    title: 'Stakeholders influence to reduce vitamin A deficiency in children aged 15 to 23 months in Iran: an analysis of stakeholders and networking.',
    abstract: 'UNLABELLED: AIME: Vitamin A deficiency remains a significant public health concern in developing countries, substantially contributing to morbidity and mortality among young children. In Iran, the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among children aged 15 to 23 months increased during the decade from 2002 to 2012, mostly due to socio-economic reasons. Given the complexity of managing this deficiency, multiple stakeholders are involved in its prevention and treatment. The objective of this study is to identify these stakeholders and assess their interests, influence, and interconnections to enhance coordinated efforts in addressing vitamin A deficiency.\n' +
      "METHOD: In this qualitative study, we identified primary and secondary stakeholders through interviews with experts and key informants, as well as content analysis of relevant documents. To examine the interactions between stakeholders' power, interests, and positions, we utilized Policy-Maker software (Version 4). Additionally, we employed Gephi software (Version 0.9.2) for social network analysis, mapping stakeholder relationships to enhance our understanding of their interconnected dynamics.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Our research identified 45 stakeholders, categorized as follows: 71% from the public sector, 4.5% international entities, 11.11% private organizations, and 13% from civil society groups. Additionally, 62% of stakeholders were associated with the executive domain, while 38% belonged to the education sector. Degree centrality ranged from 1 to 12, Closeness centrality scores ranged from 0.25 to 0.67, indicating moderate to high accessibility within the network. Athough the Ministry of Health and Medical Education was identified as the most influential stakeholder, and also it plays a key role in collaboration with other stakeholders, multiple stakeholders, including NGOs, universities, and international organizations such as UNICEF and FAO, also played significant roles in reducing Vitamin A deficiency. Network analysis metrics-including degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centralities-indicated that the highest degree value was attributed to the Secretariat of the Supreme Council for Health and Food Security (affiliated with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education), UNICEF, FAO, and the Deputy of Public Health within universities of medical sciences.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Addressing vitamin A deficiency among children aged 15-24 months in Iran requires a coordinated and strategic approach, with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education serving as the key stakeholder. While the ministry plays a central role in legislative efforts and collaboration, the relatively low to medium level of interest among other key stakeholders highlights the need for proactive engagement. Strengthening awareness through targeted advocacy, continuous negotiations, and deliberate outreach can enhance stakeholder involvement and ensure effective policy implementation. By fostering stronger partnerships and promoting informed decision-making, a more sustainable and impactful approach to reducing vitamin A deficiency can be achieved.',

    title: 'Preferences for life-sustaining treatments in advance decisions: a cross-sectional survey of Taiwanese general public.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Taiwan passed the Patient Right to Autonomy Act in 2016 and introduced a legal document called advance decision to address dilemmas in making life-sustaining treatment (LST) decisions for incompetent patients. However, the proportion of Taiwanese adults who have completed an advance decision remains low, and public preference trends are unclear.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted among Taiwanese adults using a structured questionnaire to assess preferences regarding five types of LSTs across four hypothetical clinical scenarios (late-stage motor neuron disease, severe dementia, irreversible coma, and terminal cancer). Participants were categorized based on their preference patterns, and factors associated with each subgroup were analyzed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of the 3188 individuals contacted, 2440 declined to participate, and 748 (24.3%) respondents were successfully interviewed. A total of 747 responses were included in the analysis. Latent class analysis identified four preference subgroups: pro-forgo (more than half of the respondents), neutral, aggressive, and motor-neuron-disease specific. Older age, higher education, and better quality of life were associated with a greater likelihood of belonging to the pro-forgo group, while being male, unmarried, currently not working, or not residing in northern Taiwan were associated with a lower likelihood.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Most respondents expressed a consistent preference to forgo LSTs in the hypothetical clinical scenarios. This suggests that the advance decision, implemented in 2019, may align with public needs. However, given the low completion rate and prevalent preference patterns, policymakers should increase efforts to ensure that those in need have access to appropriate resources and consider implementing a tiered signing process.',

    title: 'HIV/AIDS among migrants in Morocco: a cross-sectional biobehavioral study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Morocco has become a transit and destination country for thousands of migrants, primarily from sub-Saharan African countries. Migrant groups in Morocco are recognized as key populations vulnerable to HIV/AIDS in the national strategic plans on HIV. This study aims to describe the HIV status, knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors among a sample of migrants in northeastern Morocco, as well as their access to HIV prevention, testing and counseling services.\n' +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional biobehavioral survey described the prevalence of HIV, HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and risk behaviors among migrant populations in Oujda, northeastern Morocco. Using respondent-driven sampling (RDS), adult migrants aged > 18 years, residing in the study area for more than 3 months, and fluent in French or English were included in the study. Data collection was conducted using a questionnaire covering demographics, HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes, risk behaviors, and HIV testing. HIV testing included initial rapid tests and confirmatory tests for reactive specimens and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for discordant or indeterminate results.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among the 290 respondents, HIV prevalence was 1.7%. About 82% had heard of HIV, half of whom were aware of protective measures such as abstinence (50.4%), condom use (50.8%), and monogamy (47.5%). Awareness of HIV mother-to-child transmission was less than 40%. Regarding attitudes, 77.9% would care for an HIV-positive person at home, 82.8% would keep their HIV status confidential, and over 40% supported HIV-positive students and teachers continuing education. Significant differences in knowledge and attitudes scores were found across age, gender and marital status. Half of the participants (50.7%) reported having ever been tested for HIV, of whom 97.9% received HIV test results, and 61.6% received counseling after the test.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that the prevalence of HIV infection among migrants is greater than that among the general population (less than 0.1% in the general population) and that some challenges remain, such as stigmatizing attitudes, suboptimal understanding of HIV prevention, and substandard access to post-test counseling. Based on these findings, it is crucial to highlight the importance of strengthening HIV prevention efforts among migrants and addressing the social, behavioral and environmental factors that contribute to the spread of HIV.',

    title: "Chinese dental students' knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding traumatic dental injuries in immature permanent teeth.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The appropriate management of traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) in immature permanent teeth is critical for predicting prognosis and preserving injured teeth. However, providing accurate treatment is always challenging for dental students due to their limited knowledge of TDIs. This study aimed to assess TDIs in immature permanent teeth in terms of knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practice among Chinese dental undergraduates and residents.\n' +
      'METHODS: Dental undergraduates (in 3rd -, 4th -, and 5th -years) and residents (in 1st -, 2nd -, and 3rd -years) at the School of Stomatology, Wuhan University (763 in total, from May to June 2024), were distributed with a structured electronic questionnaire containing 22 items. The obtained data was statistically analyzed via the Chi-square (χ) test (p < 0.05) using SPSS.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Participants from various academic levels completed 502 questionnaires, with a response rate of 65.79%. Approximately half of the participants (58.6%) were familiar with TDIs, chiefly through traditional classroom learning (90.0%). Participants had limited knowledge on correct emergency treatment for TDIs, including tooth replantation timing (51.6%), fixation method (43.8%), and time (25.5%), with 3rd -year undergraduates reporting the lowest percentage (10.2%) (p < 0.05). Most participants agreed that vital pulp preservation (95.0%) and additional examination (91.0%) are essential for TDI management. Besides, only 29.9% of participants had ever treated a clinical TDI case independently. The majority of participants expressed a strong desire to gain comprehensive knowledge of TDIs (90.0%) and additional training (96.4%).\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Dental students at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels lacked sufficient knowledge and practice with TDIs but had a positive attitude toward TDI management. Thus, it would be enormously beneficial for dental students to gain a better understanding of TDIs through improved dental education, including multiple teaching methodologies and more clinical practice.\n' +

    title: 'Prevalence of oral mucosal lesions and associated risk factors in a Norwegian adult population - the HUNT4 Oral Health study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Most studies on the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions (OMLs), including those from Norway, focus on patient populations. This study aimed to estimate the overall prevalence of OMLs and its types across different age groups and to examine their association with selected risk factors in a general adult population of Norway.\n' +
      'METHODS: This cross-sectional study included a random sample of 4,909 individuals aged 19 years and older who completed questionnaires and underwent a standardized clinical examination for OMLs in the HUNT Oral Health Survey (2017-2019). The classification of OMLs was based on the World Health Organization and NHANES III guidelines. Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression to assess associations between OMLs and potential risk factors, adjusting for relevant confounders.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The overall prevalence of OMLs was 7.5%, with a higher proportion observed in individuals aged 60 and older. The most prevalent oral lesions were exophytic lesions (3.1%) and white lesions (1.5%). Notably, individuals with a low/middle level of education had higher odds of having an OMLs than those with a higher level of education (OR, 1.27, 95% CI: 1.00-1.61) in the fully adjusted model. Exploratory analyses of lesion types found a positive association between smoking status and white lesions (OR, 1.77, 95% CI:1.05-2.97), as well as between a history of cancer and red-blue lesions (OR, 2.17, 95% CI, 1.14-4.11).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: In this population-based study, 7.5% of Norwegian adults had one or more OMLs, with higher prevalence in participants aged 60 years and older. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in similar populations.',

    title: "A pioneering health education strategy based on the PRECEDE-PROCEED model for women's health challenges: a systematic review and logic framework.",
    abstract: "PURPOSE: This review seeks to examine the effectiveness of PRECEDE-PROCEED model- based interventions on women's behaviors, health, quality of life and determinants during health challenges as well as associations between their constructs. Additionally, it aims to propose a logical framework for enhancing women's behaviors, health, quality of life and determinants during health challenges.\n" +
      "METHODS: In April 2025, three databases- PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct- were searched. The search included words in the Title, Abstract, and Keywords without any time limitations. The search was filtered by Clinical Trial or Randomized Clinical Trial for PubMed, Article for Scopus, and Research articles for Science Direct. Studies conducted among women that utilized an educational intervention based on the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, were written in full-text English, and used validated quantitative health questionnaires were included in the analysis. Descriptive, cross-sectional designs as well as qualitative, longitudinal, or non-original studies were excluded from the review. The risk of bias in the included interventional studies was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and the Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I tool) which were specifically adapted for these study designs. The main objective of the interventional studies was to investigate the effectiveness of PRECEDE-PROCEED model-based interventions on women's behaviors, health, quality of life and determinants during health challenges. A review was conducted based on the AMSTAR checklist, PRISMA checklist and PRISMA flow diagram. Data extraction was performed with the consensus of two authors, and a narrative synthesis approach was chosen for data synthesis, following the guidelines provided by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD).\n" +
      `RESULTS: Seven interventional studies were included in the final analysis. Our findings revealed that all reviewed studies provided evidence of the effectiveness of a PRECEDE-PROCEED- based intervention for improving women's behaviors, health, quality of life and determinants during health challenges. However, due to the absence of standardized measurement indicators to identify and compare the outcomes of various studies, there is a need to develop a conceptual framework that could enhance our understanding of women's health challenges including childbirth, postpartum, menopause and genital infections. This framework aims to incorporate knowledge and positive attitudes towards healthy behaviors and health-related challenging conditions, as well as self-efficacy as important "predisposing factors." It also considers social support and supportive policies as crucial "reinforcing factors." Furthermore, it acknowledges resources, skills, services and their cost as necessary "enabling factors." Lastly, it recognizes healthy behaviors and a favorable environment as "impacts," alongside improved health and optimal quality of life as significant "outcomes" of these factors.\n` +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The proposed conceptual framework could define a PRECEDE-PROCEED-based intervention as an effective "health education strategy" for addressing the most significant health challenges facing women.',
