    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'AI Responses to Challenging Problems and Educator Responses to AI Availability',
    summary: 'This article considers the rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the context of secondary mathematics education, focusing on its responses to cognitively demanding tasks and the pedagogical implications of these interactions. Using tools such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google), we investigate how GenAI engages in complex mathematical reasoning and problem-solving beyond the capabilities of traditional digital tools. Our analysis reveals that, although GenAI thus far tends to typically produce tasks of low cognitive demand, it clearly exhibits an ability to respond to cognitively-demanding mathematical tasks. We share examples of GenAI responses to three tasks from secondary mathematics, and, although the GenAI made substantial errors, it also demonstrated an ability to revise and refine its work with prompting. For educators faced with GenAI, we argue against banning its use and instead propose two instructional strategies to promote student learning in this new AI era: (1) fostering student interaction with GenAI to explore and expand on mathematical concepts and (2) encouraging students to critically evaluate and discuss GenAI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. These instructional strategies aim to enhance students’ mathematical understanding and critical thinking skills by using GenAI as a tool that can promote substantive student involvement and meaningful learning. (An initial draft of this abstract was produced by ChatGPT 4.0, but GenAI was not used in any other way for this article, other than as an interactive partner within the excerpts as clearly marked.)',

    title: 'Making Tens with Four Hands: Touchscreen-Based Classroom Activity for Early Number Learning',
    summary: 'As schools increasingly embrace embodied learning, there is a growing need to incorporate classroom teaching and learning activities that recognize the body’s role as both an individual and collective resource for cognition and instruction. In response, we present a design for a classroom teaching sequence focused on early number learning, featuring pedagogical activities supported by TouchCounts (TC) and engaged by pairs of children using their four hands. These activities showcase the potential of embodied learning for children to explore concepts such as odd and even numbers, as well as the composition and decomposition of numbers up to and including ten. We elaborate on the functionalities of TC, outline the teaching sequence, and offer episodes of our classroom observations. Specifically, we present three lesson snapshots aimed at first-graders (aged 6 to 7) using a class set of TC, student learning outcomes, and notable observations as students interact with the touchscreen environment. For example, we note that the student pairs used their hands to reinforce, extend, and redirect mathematical ideas; besides, they developed a collective discourse through (gestural) subitizing the number of fingers that they (and their partner) put up (and folded down). This snapshot explicates the collective learning experiences in classroom settings involving pair-work activities and informs existing work on embodied (mathematical) cognition beyond how students learn with their bodies individually.',

    summary: 'In this article, we investigate the effects of the app Fingu on a child’s understanding of the part-whole concept. Using the Artifact Centric Activity Theory framework, we initially analyse the internalisation and externalisation processes that appear to occur during one child’s use of the app. Based on the learning from this process, we then use other aspects of the framework, in particular the subject-artifact-group triangle, to understand how Fingu might be used productively in mathematics education classrooms. Using a 13-min video of a child playing Fingu as our data source, we analyse how children might, as they learn about part-whole relationships, interact with the game. We also investigate how design principles in creating apps can impact on the experience of using the app in ways that may be unintended by their designers. This work has implications for app designers and for mathematics educators seeking to incorporate digital technologies into mathematics education.',

    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Art and design teachers’ personal rules of thumb while designing instruction for studios',
    summary: "In higher vocational education, innovations are shifting from teacher-oriented to student-oriented education and hybrid learning environments. Designing these innovative environments is complex. This study aimed to gain insight into art and design teachers’ rules of thumb when designing instruction in studios. The rules of thumb from experienced designers of design education provide insight into the practical knowledge essential for creating effective studio learning environments. These rules of thumb, derived from teachers' practical knowledge, outline teachers’ ideas about characteristics design education should have to achieve specific student learning outcomes. Six teachers participated in this case study, to investigate this phenomenon in a real-world context. During interviews, they designed a studio for their teaching practice while thinking aloud, expressing their thoughts, actions, and reasoning. These teachers had at least four years of experience in designing art and design studios and were still active in their roles. Within and cross-case analysis revealed that learning theories are recognizable in teachers’ rules of thumb when designing studio instruction. Teachers and their rules of thumb span a spectrum from cognitivism to social constructivism, with most teachers oriented towards social constructivism. This aligns with strategic design considerations at studios, which are also based on social constructivism. Typical social-constructivist rules of thumb focus on student ownership of their learning process and fostering collaboration between various actors in an authentic context. The rules of thumb from experienced designers are incorporated into the training of current and future studio designers and may inspire those who create similar innovative learning environments.",

    summary: 'Design thinking is a cognitive, iterative process that involves identifying goals, understanding users, and creating solutions. It has changed from a designers’ activity to an all-around approach to the innovation process and become a pedagogical phenomenon. In this article, design thinking method is studied in an educational context among young learners (children aged 5–8) through a literature review. The aim of this review is to gain an understanding of the reasons why and the ways in which design thinking is applied as an educational method in early childhood education and care. Through the review, we aim to find new ideas for teaching craft, design, and technology education with young learners. We present the results of 20 peer-reviewed articles reporting empirical studies of applying design thinking methods in an educational context with young learners. The results show that previous research has identified three themes of reasons to apply design thinking in early childhood education and care: enhancing multidisciplinary teaching, teaching design thinking as a method and supporting children’s developmental domains, and participatory learning. The ways to apply design thinking with young learners also coalesced into three themes: children acting as designers by solving real-life problems, open-ended science problems, and challenges in imaginary play. In conclusion, we consider these findings from the perspective of teaching craft, design, and technology education for young learners.',

    title: 'Alopecia in Female Athletes Using Androgenic and Anabolic Steroids: Pathophysiology and Management.',
    abstract: 'Performance-enhancing substances (PES) are used by many athletes worldwide to improve performance and enhance appearance. Although PES are more commonly used by men, use is increasing among women, leading to growing physical and psychosocial concerns. Illegal PES include androgenic and anabolic steroids (AAS), which represent a diverse class of synthetic derivatives of testosterone. PES use has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, neurologic, infectious, hepatic, renal, and musculoskeletal disorders. Additionally, hormonal alterations secondary to PES use can induce or accelerate female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Despite the widespread prevalence of FPHL, research has disproportionately focused on male pattern hair loss (MPHL) and male athletes utilizing PES. This review article explores the pathophysiology of testosterone, gender-based AAS dosing implications, incidence of FPHL, physical and psychosocial impacts of alopecia, and management strategies. Though research regarding the impact of androgen-based PES on hair health exists, few studies address these issues in the context of female athletes. Importantly, clinicians must be equipped to provide female athletes with education regarding potential risks of AAS and to appropriately manage FPHL in this patient population. Furthermore, timely diagnosis and treatment of FPHL, alongside AAS cessation, are crucial to preventing further hair loss and optimizing the safety and efficacy of alopecia treatments. Given the compounded psychosocial concerns among female athletes worldwide on PES-including hair loss, body image insecurities, and even eating disorders-ongoing research in this area is critical.',

    title: "Being the nurse's eyes and ears: a mixed methods study of assistant nurses' perceptions of their role regarding drug-related problems in nursing homes.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Insufficient knowledge among assistant nurses (ANs) in nursing homes (NHs) on medicines and drug-related problems (DRPs) in older people causes difficulties in acknowledging the side effects of medications, which can be harmful to the individual and endangers patient safety. The aim of this study was to explore the ANs' thoughts on their professional role in preventing DRPs in NH residents, their self-perceived knowledge about medicines, DRPs and physiological conditions in older people, and their wishes concerning further medical education.\n" +
      'METHODS: This mixed methods study took place in Sweden, in 2022. First, a survey was conducted at nine NHs, with a total of 112 respondents. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and groups were compared using t-tests. Thereafter, semi-structured interviews were performed at four NHs and included 20 participants. A qualitative content analysis was performed.\n' +
      `RESULTS: In the survey, a generally good self-perceived knowledge of medicines was reported. In the interviews, three main categories were identified: "Professional role of the AN", "Perspectives on pharmacotherapy in older people" and "Approaches to knowledge". Their professional role entailed different aspects, including the central assignment of observing the residents whilst having delimited responsibilities and knowledge. Regarding pharmacotherapy, the self-perceived knowledge was generally good, but more specific questions regarding DRPs proved a lack of widespread competence. An approach to obtain more knowledge was found in the possibility for ANs to attend ward rounds. A latent theme emerged in the professional role of the AN in preventing DRPs by being the nurse's eyes and ears for patient safety.\n` +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The AN's perceived their professional role in preventing DRPs in NHs as being the nurse's eyes and ears for patient safety. Generally, the ANs' self-perceived knowledge of medicines was good, although self-perceived knowledge regarding DRPs, and the physiology of older people, was sparser. A positive attitude towards attending ward rounds to contribute firsthand information on the residents, as well as the opportunity to receive knowledge, existed among the respondents. We propose a working model within the framework of doctor's ward rounds at NHs to increase the knowledge of ANs and utilise their knowledge of patients' well-being for safe medication follow-up.",

    title: "Effect of educational training about CAM-ICU on nurses' knowledge, confidence, and practice to detect delirium among critically ill patients in intensive care unit.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a serious complication associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and long-term cognitive decline. Early detection through standardized assessment tools is critical to improving patient outcomes. This study evaluated the effect of an educational training program on ICU nurses' self-reported knowledge, perceived self-confidence, and comfort levels in using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), as well as their observed performance in delirium assessment and documentation.\n" +
      'METHODS: A quasi-experimental single-group pretest-posttest design was conducted with 50 ICU nurses in an Egyptian ICU. Participants received a four-week educational program on delirium and CAM-ICU use. Knowledge, confidence, and comfort levels were measured before and after training using validated questionnaires. Post-training performance was assessed using an observational checklist evaluating assessment accuracy, documentation completeness, and consistency. Paired t-test was used for data analysis.\n' +
      "RESULTS: ICU nurses' knowledge and confidence in using the CAM-ICU significantly improved after training (p < .001). Post-training, assessment accuracy (95.5%) and documentation completeness (91.3%) were high, while practice consistency (79%) met the satisfactory threshold (≥ 75%), indicating satisfactory performance in delirium assessment and documentation using CAM-ICU.\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The educational training significantly improved ICU nurses' knowledge, perceived self-confidence, comfort levels, and practical skills in delirium assessment using the CAM-ICU, leading to more accurate and consistent screening practices. Structured, interactive training should be integrated into ICU education to promote standardized delirium assessment in ICU settings.\n" +
      'IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Integrating structured delirium education into ICU training can promote adherence to best practices, ensuring timely detection and intervention. Future research should examine long-term skill retention and its effect on patient outcomes.\n' +

    title: "Professional educators' experiences teaching internationally educated nurses attending bridging programs: a qualitative interview study.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: To aid in the recertification and integration process of internationally educated nurses (IENs), many countries have organized bridging programs to provide support and education and align their knowledge and competence with local requirements. The importance and relevance of these programs for IENs are highlighted in related research. However, the experiences of university teachers, supervisors in clinical placement, and administrators organizing these programs are scarcely explored. The aim of this article is to explore the experiences of professional educators engaged in bridging programs at two universities in Sweden.\n' +
      'METHODS: A descriptive qualitative approach was employed. The data were collected between December 2021 and March 2023 through semi-structured interviews with 15 educators involved in bridging programs at two universities in Sweden. The participants included university teachers, administrators, and supervisors in clinical placement. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis.\n' +
      'FINDINGS: The thematic analysis identified two main themes: (1) teaching a heterogeneous group of students and (2) organizational constraints of bridging programs. In relation to the first main theme, three subthemes were identified: educational and professional heterogeneity of IENs, varying language competencies of IENs and finding new approaches to teaching IENs. For the second main theme, three sub-themes were identified: compressed time in bridging programs, lack of resources for a time-consuming education and bridging programs as competition for resources.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the understanding of the challenges associated with the recertification process of IENs through bridging programs from the perspective of educators. The findings highlight that educating a heterogeneous group of students, such as internationally educated nurses with differences in professional experience, knowledge and local language competencies, is time-consuming. Educators need to learn about the level of knowledge of the student group and individual learning needs and adapt the instructions accordingly, which is constrained by the organization of the programs. The findings also indicate that educators can find ways to mitigate these challenges and adapt their instructions to meet the needs of students. Therefore, it is important to allocate time and resources to running bridging programs and to support the cooperation and exchange of information between universities and clinics. We also suggest the need to increase the competency level of educators on how to support learning through a second language and enhancing collaboration with language instructors to ensure high-quality education for IENs.',

    title: 'From garbage to green in the operating room: an anesthesiology resident-led soft plastics recycling quality improvement project.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Anesthesia contributes up to 25% of operating room (OR) waste. We sought to conduct a quality improvement project to initiate soft plastic recycling, aiming to recycle 1,000 g per day of soft plastic.\n' +
      'METHODS: In this single-centre, anesthesiology resident-led quality improvement initiative in British Columbia, Canada, we started a soft plastics recycling collection program in a single operating room (OR) and expanded it to 12 ORs through a series of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The outcome measure was the daily weight of soft plastics recycled. We tracked the number of mistakes as a balancing measure. We collected data eight months after the conclusion of the project to assess sustained changes. We visualized data with Shewhart control charts.\n' +
      'RESULTS: One OR resulted in a mean (standard deviation [SD]) of 194 (157) g of soft plastics collected daily. Once we expanded to all ORs, a mean (SD) of 1,524 (708) g of waste was collected daily. A mean (SD) of 1,284 (613) g was recycled daily during the eight-month follow-up. There was a median [interquartile range (IQR)] of 0 [0-2] mistakes per day with only one OR, which increased to a median [IQR] of 2 [1-4] mistakes per day upon expansion, and remained low at eight months, with a median [IQR] of 1 [0-3] mistake per day. E-mail reminders and signage improved the error rate.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: We successfully introduced and sustained a soft plastics collection program in our centre's OR suite with the aim to stream it for recycling. Monitoring and education were helpful in growing the program and reducing errors.",

    abstract: 'Lyophilized drugs and biologics have an outsized role in protecting public health due to their ability to provide extended shelf life for stockpiling. Over 70% (14 out of 19) of antibiotics on the Essential Medicines list are supplied as lyophilized sterile powders for injection (FDA, 1). Additionally, many new drugs, including first-in-kind medicines, such as the first checkpoint inhibitor cancer immunotherapy Keytruda, were initially introduced to market in a lyophilized form, accelerating availability to patients by several years while a stable liquid formulation was being developed. The article describes methodologies, both short-term and long-term, to address the current manufacturing challenges for lyophilized injectables based on the findings of the workshop by National Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology and Education held in January 2024.',

    title: 'Qualitative Evaluation of a Vicarious Trauma e-learning Initiative for Cancer Support Line Workers in the UK.',
    abstract: "The concept of vicarious traumatisation (VT) is distinguished from psychological stress concepts of 'burnout', 'compassion fatigue', and 'secondary traumatic stress'. Cancer support line workers may have a heightened risk of VT. Taking education as an intervention for VT, the aim of this study was to capture pre- and post-perceptions of an e-learning intervention for cancer support line workers. To explore cancer support line workers' perceptions of VT pre- and post- e-learning intervention. Ten study participants were surveyed prior to a VT e-learning intervention. Nine study participants completed e-learning, followed by semi-structured interviews. Reflexive thematic analysis was utilised. Five themes emerged: pre-existing understanding of VT, resonance, recognition, refocus self-care, and reflection on the impact of VT experience. Varied levels of understanding of the concept of VT were identified. The module was impactful and increased understanding of VT for most participants. A requirement for formalised VT education, subsequent signposting, and support, was identified. Participants expressed desire for refresher courses.",

    title: 'Diabetogenic elevated childhood total fat in South Asian and Black African/Caribbean people relates to adverse early life growth and low socioeconomic position compared with White people in the UK.',
    abstract: 'AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Excess type 2 diabetes mellitus in minority ethnic groups remains unexplained, although greater fat mass makes a strong contribution. We hypothesised that height and weight through infancy in South Asian and Black African/Caribbean subgroups is more adverse than in White populations. These, allied to poor socioeconomic position, determine greater fat mass at age 7 years.\n' +
      'METHODS: We report a secondary analysis from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, including 12,280 births of White ethnicity, and 358 of Indian, 650 of Pakistani, 268 of Bangladeshi, 163 of Black Caribbean and 277 of Black African ethnicity between 2000 and 2002. Birthweight was reported, and heights and weights were measured at ages 3, 5, 7, 11, 14 and 17 years. Bioimpedance captured fat mass, indexed to height, at ages 7, 11, 14 and 17 years. Standardised differences in anthropometry, using the White group as the comparator, were calculated. We explored the effect of early growth on ethnic differences in fat-mass index at age 7 years. Confounders included maternal anthropometry, smoking, infant breastfeeding, education, parental income and area-level socioeconomic deprivation.\n' +
      'RESULTS: All minority ethnic subgroups had lower birthweight and accelerated infant height and weight growth compared with White children. By age 3 years, mean height was greater in all minority ethnic groups than in White children. This height advantage was progressively lost, first in Bangladeshi children. By age 17 years in boys/girls, Indians were 1.77/2.48 cm, Pakistanis 2.24/3.44 cm, Bangladeshis 4.83/5.95 cm and Black Caribbeans 1.64/0.49 cm shorter than White children. Heights were equivalent in Black African children. By age 17 years, all South Asian children were lighter, and Black African/Caribbean children heavier, than White children. The anthropometric gradient by ethnicity in children mirrored that in mothers. Girls from minority ethnic groups were more likely to be menstruating by age 11 years than White girls (range 12-27% vs 9%). At age 7 years, standardised fat-mass index (kg/m) in boys/girls was 0.17/0.01 SDs greater in Indian, 0.21/0.04 in Pakistani, 0.18/0.16 in Bangladeshi, 0.48/0.35 in Black Caribbean and 0.37/0.75 in Black African children than in White children. These differences persisted to age 17 years. Weight gain to age 3 years, and in Black Africans/Caribbeans, adverse individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic position, contributed to ethnic differences in fat mass.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Minority ethnic groups in the UK have poorer childhood growth than White children, achieving shorter height, greater fat mass and earlier female puberty. Mirroring of maternal and offspring ethnic subgroup gradients in height and weight indicates intergenerational transmission. Persistent adverse socioeconomic circumstances perpetuate ethnic adversity in early life accrual of body fat.\n' +

    title: 'Clinical and patient-reported outcomes of distal femur fracture fixation in adults aged 18-50 years.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: To describe nonunion and fracture-related infection (FRI) rates and patient-reported outcomes following operative treatment for distal femur fractures in young patients.\n' +
      'METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients (aged 18-50) who were operatively treated for a distal femur fracture between 2006 and 2023 with ≥ 3-month clinical follow-up at two Level 1 Trauma Centers. Outcomes included reoperation for nonunion and FRI; and PROMIS physical function (PF), depression, and anxiety (reference population mean: 50). Multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors associated with PROMIS-PF.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Eighty-six patients met inclusion criteria. The median age was 34 years, 71% were male, 42% had an open fracture, and for 38 patients PROMIS scores were collected at an average of 9.8 years after treatment. Eleven patients (13%) required reoperation for nonunion and 3 (3.5%) for FRI. Median PROMIS-PF was 47.0 (IQR: 41.2-52.4), depression 45.8 (IQR: 38.9-53.6), and anxiety 46.7 (IQR: 39.5-60.5). PROMIS-PF was lower than the reference population score (p < 0.05). Increased age (1-year; ß: - 0.39; 95%CI: - 0.62 to - 0.17; p < 0.001) and BMI (1-unit; ß: - 0.59; 95%CI: - 0.98 to - 0.20; p = 0.004) at time of injury were associated with worse PROMIS-PF scores and longer follow-up (1-year; ß: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.3; p = 0.004) with better scores.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: One in 8 young patients with a distal femur fracture underwent reoperation for nonunion and one in 33 for FRI. Physical function scores were marginally lower than the reference population, whereas depression and anxiety scores were similar. The finding that physical function scores were more influenced by baseline patient factors than injury characteristics is important for prognostication and patient education. These results should be interpreted in the context of the small sample size, and future research with larger cohorts is needed to confirm these findings and better understand long-term functional outcomes in young patients following treatment of distal femur fractures.',

    title: 'Assessment of Awareness, Attitude, and Opinion of Indian Farmers on Microplastic Pollution in Agroecosystems.',
    abstract: "The increasing use of plastics in agriculture is contributing to persistent microplastic or nanoplastic pollution, which contaminates soil and affects agroecosystems. Understanding farmers' knowledge and practices is crucial for mitigating this issue. This study examines the awareness, attitudes, and opinions of Indian farmers regarding microplastic pollution. A survey of 310 crop farmers from 19 regions of India was conducted from September 2023 to March 2024 using a random sampling method to assess their knowledge, practices, attitudes, and opinions. The findings highlight limited awareness about microplastics, with only 33.5% of respondents having prior knowledge, and 66.5% were unaware of microplastic pollution. Random forest analysis identified education as the most significant predictor of farmers' awareness and attitudes toward microplastic pollution, followed by age and gender. Additionally, 74.8% of farmers expressed significant concern about the impact of plastic pollution on agriculture and human health, and 90% of respondents expressed strong interest in learning how to minimize microplastic pollution. The study recommends policies that holistically address plastic pollution in agroecosystems, like integrating plastic waste management into the existing national policies, biodegradable alternatives, stakeholder engagement, market incentives, state-specific training programs, research, and outreach activities. These findings have key implications for enhancing environmental sustainability and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.",
