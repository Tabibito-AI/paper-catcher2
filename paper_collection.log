    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'Optimization of Corporate Governance from the Perspectives of Law and Economics and Blockchain',
    summary: 'Blockchain’s spontaneous consensus mechanism, characterized by technologies of decentralization, immutability, high transparency, and codification, helps address agency costs and the formalization of shareholder meetings in traditional corporate governance. With the advancement of blockchain technology, the integration of legal rules and code rules in corporate governance has become the new norm. As per the transaction cost theory of law and economics and the Coase Theorem, blockchain has promoted changes in governance rules by markedly reducing agency costs within companies. Corporate governance will exhibit partial and gradual adjustments when blockchain technology substantially diminishes these costs but falls short of achieving the optimal state of zero transaction costs. These changes not only enhance the transparency and efficiency of corporate governance but also effectively curb the misconduct of controlling shareholders and protect the rights of minority shareholders.',

    summary: 'Although Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) presents vast opportunities and potential within the educational domain, the optimal integration of educational theory with GAI to enhance academic performance and problem-solving skills remains an area that requires further exploration. Therefore, this study aims to develop an integrating GAI with self-explanations scaffolding platform to enhance students’ learning performance and problem-solving skills through completing scaffolding tasks. Furthermore, this study evaluates students’ perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the system based on the Technology Acceptance Model. The findings indicate that students in the experimental group demonstrated a significant improvement in learning performance and problem-solving skills after utilizing the platform proposed by this study. Additionally, the experimental group exhibited positive technology acceptance toward the platform. Finally, results from the semi-structured interviews suggest that learning programming through the self-explanations scaffolding platform can mitigate learning setbacks, provide cognitive guidance, strengthen conceptual connections, facilitate knowledge construction, and enhance application skills.',

Topic modeling using BERTopic revealed that the experimental group's reflections focused more on strategy adjustment, logical reasoning, and conceptual understanding, whereas the control group's reflections were more descriptive and operational. These findings suggest that AI-supported structured feedback can enhance the quality of student reflections, increase learning engagement, and improve collaborative interactions. This study demonstrates the practical value and effectiveness of AI-assisted reflection within the 6E+R instructional model, offering new directions for reflective design in STEM collaborative learning and expanding the potential of generative AI in educational settings.",

    title: 'Non-Immersive Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) with XR Elements in Nursing Education: Learning Interaction and Clinical Competence',
    summary: 'The way nursing students acquire clinical competence and patient safety awareness has changed as a result of the adoption of virtual learning environments (VLEs) in healthcare education. Non-immersive VLEs that display virtual scenarios offer secure learning experiences. Easily accessible and reasonably priced non-immersive VLEs can safely enhance learning clinical procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no earlier research on non-immersive VLEs with extended reality (XR) elements in nursing education, and this research fills that gap. This study investigates nursing students’ expectations and experiences of using non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to learn interaction and clinical competence, such as infusion pump operations. It also explores the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the use of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements in this context. Fifteen first-year nursing students engaged in two non-immersive learning scenarios. The learning process was structured using a seven-phase simulation pedagogy. The data were collected using pre- and post-questionnaires; group discussions; and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings highlight the potential of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to enhance engagement, confidence, and competence acquisition in nursing students while complementing traditional hands-on training. The study highlights the importance of blended learning strategies that integrate technical and scenario-based approaches, as well as simulation pedagogy, to optimize knowledge retention and clinical competency development. As digital technologies continue to shape healthcare education, non-immersive VLEs with XR elements are valuable in bridging the gap between theory and practice, ultimately contributing to patient safety and improved healthcare outcomes.',

    title: 'A Virtual Reality-Based Co-creation Approach to Developing Narrative Competence and Empathy in EFL Nursing Education',
    summary: 'This study investigates the use of virtual reality (VR) as a pedagogical tool to foster English narrative competence and empathy among nursing students in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. Through a 16-week course-integrated intervention, 98 third-year nursing students in a five-year associate degree program at a junior nursing college participated in a co-creation project using CoSpaces Edu to collaboratively design immersive, first-person 3D narratives based on an end-of-life care scenario. The project aimed to develop students’ linguistic skills while promoting humanistic understanding through perspective-taking. Employing a mixed-methods design, the study incorporated pre- and post-intervention vocabulary tests, oral narrative evaluations, student reflections, and interviews. Results demonstrated significant gains in English vocabulary and narrative expression, increased oral confidence, and evidence of enhanced empathy as students adopted diverse character roles in their digital stories. The findings underscore the pedagogical affordances of VR-based co-creation in EFL instruction for healthcare students, revealing how immersive storytelling can bridge language learning with humanistic nursing education. Implications for XR-enhanced language education and interdisciplinary curriculum design are discussed.',

We integrated 11 network metrics from published research and tested them on six eye-tracking datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that no consistent predictor variable can effectively predict student performance across different datasets. The number of nodes, edges, reciprocity, and entropy measures contribute differently to predicting students’ performance. This work deepens our understanding of how different SNA metrics relate to eye-tracking data and advances the methodological framework to predict learning outcomes.',

Drawing on reflexive thematic analysis of focus group interviews with three cohorts of peer assistants (N = 10), the study identifies three interconnected components: a pedagogical foundation rooted in sociocultural learning theory, a structured train-the-trainer program cycle, and a set of innovation enablers, including inclusive design, co-creation, and the cultivation of a digital mindset. The findings highlight how peer educators, through their dual roles as learners and facilitators, emerge as digital change agents capable of driving innovation from within the learning environment. The model extends existing PAL frameworks by positioning students not only as knowledge sharers but also as agents of educational technology integration. While grounded in occupational therapy education, the VR-PAL model offers a transferable approach for institutions aiming to scale student-centered digital innovation. Implications for implementation, scalability, and future research are discussed.',

    title: 'A comparison of the costs and patterns of expenditure for care for severe mental illness in five countries with different levels of economic development.',
    abstract: 'AIMS: The aim of the article is to undertake the first economic analysis exploring the costs of illness (COIs) and factors affecting COIs in people living with mental disorders using individual patient-level data across five countries with different national income levels. This is done by investigating diagnosis-related and sociodemographic factors for country-specific medical and psychosocial service use in these high, lower-middle and low-income countries.\n' +
      'METHODS: Using data from the Using Peer Support In Developing Empowering Mental Health Services (UPSIDES) study, a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, costs for medical and psychosocial services have been estimated over 6 months in 615 people with severe mental illness from Germany ( = 171), Uganda ( = 138), Tanzania ( = 110), India ( = 93) and Israel ( = 103). The primary economic analysis included (1) total COI expressed in 2021 international dollars and (2) proportional cost-type expenditures. Generalized linear regression models were also used to estimate the impact of psychiatric diagnosis, social disability, age and gender on the total COI.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of the 615 participants (mean [SD] age 38.3 [11.2] years; 335 [54.5%] women), the total 6-month COI ranged from $311.48 [±547.47] in Tanzania to $10,493.19 [±13324.10] in Germany. High-income Germany and low-income Uganda both concentrated >70% of COIs on inpatient care. High-income Israel had the most balanced COI, with the lowest mean share (15.40%) on inpatient care, compared with community (35.12%) and primary care (33.01%). Female gender was associated with lower COI ( = 0.215;  = 0.000) in Tanzania, while in India diagnosis of depression was associated with lower costs than schizophrenia ( = 0.363;  = 0.017). Health of the Nation Outcome Scale scores (social disability) were not significantly associated with COIs in any country. In Tanzania, the total mean COI increased by 3.6% for every additional year of age. Compared to Germany, mean COIs were significantly lower by 90%, 99% and 86% in Uganda, Tanzania and India, respectively, and by 50% in Israel, although this difference was not significant.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: National income is correlated with the total COI in people living with mental disorders but is a poor predictor of the sector-specific distribution of these expenditures.',

    title: 'Orthodontic Educational Landscape in the Contemporary Context: Insights from Educators.',
    abstract: 'We sought the perspectives of fourteen orthodontics educators on emerging trends and themes in the orthodontics educational landscape. The focus of this article was on four overarching areas: technology, workforce, research and clinical practice. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis showed that infusion of newer technologies is poised to change the way we train the next generation of orthodontists, open up new lines of enquiry, and alter the way we render clinical care. Areas of weakness include lack of adequate numbers of orthodontics faculty and lack of progress in Orthodontics research when compared to medical research. Our educational set up is at crucial juncture. We have to make sure that the pipeline of Orthodontics educators is well developed and our new-gen educators have the tools and skillset to adapt to the rapidly evolving healthcare landscape.',

    title: 'A Confidence and Preparedness Survey: Cognitive Interviews for Tool Assessment and Nursing Student Perspectives.',
    abstract: 'Safe medication administration is a critical responsibility of registered nurses and is an essential skill developed during nursing education. Student confidence and preparation regarding medication administration are essential aspects of professional skill building. The Confidence and Preparation Survey (CPS) was used previously among homogeneous nursing student samples. The existing dominant discourse, shaped by ideologies and systems, can unfortunately lead to limited perspectives; therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and refine the CPS for feasibility, clarity, and validity among nursing students primarily from groups that have been historically marginalized. A secondary purpose considered the conditions that affect perceived confidence and preparedness. Cognitive interviews were undertaken with baccalaureate nursing students ( = 11) attending an urban college of nursing in the Northeastern region of the United States. Data were analyzed using rapid qualitative techniques and the framework matrix method. The CPS was readily understood and interpreted by this sample. Student perspectives of conditions that influence their understanding and interpretation of the CPS are described under three themes: (1) prior outside of school healthcare experiences influence understanding, (2) school experiences support survey comprehension, and (3) concerns over insufficient training within school. Findings also include a revised CPS instrument ready for further testing.',

    title: 'Inverse association between dietary fiber intake and gallstone disease in U.S. adults: a cross-sectional study from the NHANES database.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The cross-sectional association of dietary fiber intake with gallstone disease in United States adults remains to be comprehensively elucidated.\n' +
      'METHODS: We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2017-2023. The assessment of dietary fiber intake was derived from 24-h dietary recalls. Stratified analyses were then used to demonstrate dietary fiber intake corresponding to different groups of gallstone and non-gallstone conditions. The use of weighted logistic regression was employed to explore the correlation between dietary fiber intake and gallstone disease. Subgroup and interaction analyses were used to identify potential interacting factors. Additionally, restricted cubic spline was used to assess the dose-response between dietary fiber and gallstone risk.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The study population comprised 9,273 patients, with a gallstone prevalence of 10.47% (971 cases). In the context of various subgroups, patients diagnosed with gallstones exhibited a reduced dietary fiber intake in comparison with individuals not bearing gallstones. In the fully adjusted model, an inverse association was observed between dietary fiber intake and gallstone disease (odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI); 0.98 (0.96,1.00),  value = 0.039). The highest quartile of dietary fiber intake exhibited a lower risk of gallstone disease in comparison with the lowest quartile (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: 0.65 (0.45, 0.94),  value = 0.022). The inverse correlation between dietary fiber intake and the prevalence of gallstones was found to be statistically significant in several subgroups, including males, Hispanic individuals, those with less than a high school education, alcohol consumers, and individuals diagnosed with diabetes. Furthermore, the analysis of dose-response curves indicated a nearly linear correlation between dietary fiber intake and the risk of gallstone development.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Dietary fiber intake is inversely associated with gallstone disease in United States adults. Adequate dietary fiber intake may be beneficial in reducing gallstone prevalence.',

    title: 'School-informed risk calculator tool for reducing the spread of respiratory viral infection among school-aged children.',
    abstract: 'School health staff need decision support for responding to respiratory viral outbreaks. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) tools are an inexpensive and fast resource. Our objectives were to engage school districts to inform the development of a risk-based calculator tool, test the tool across hypothetical cases, and elicit feedback among school health staff. We administered an online survey for Kindergarten (K) - Grade 5 teachers, school health professionals, and other school staff to gather data about respiratory viral disease interventions and model parameters. A risk calculator tool was developed in which users choose hypothetical scenarios to estimate infection risk per individual and compare interventions. Three case studies (CS) were explored: CS1 - Rhinovirus transmission in a general education classroom with "poor" vs. "great" air quality, CS2 - Influenza A virus transmission in a music classroom with vs. without a portable air purifier, CS3 - SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a special education classroom with vs. without open doors/windows. The prototype tool was presented at a national school nursing meeting, and attendees were surveyed on (dis)likes and anticipated tool uses. For the initial survey of Arizona school personnel (n = 132), the top respiratory viral outbreak strategies reported by teachers were hand (94 %) and surface hygiene (85.1 %). For all case studies, infection risks were above thresholds used in other contexts but were comparable to published student respiratory illness incidence data. At the national meeting, school nurses (n = 12) identified potential uses including advocating for interventions to administrators. This work reflects a unique application of community partnership and QMRA to address school health decision support.',

    title: "Improving students' performance in geometry: an empirical evidence of the effectiveness of brainstorming learning strategy.",
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The persistent challenges in geometry performance among secondary school students in Nigeria demand innovative teaching methods that extend beyond conventional strategies.\n' +
      "OBJECTIVE: This pretest and post-test quasi-experimental study investigated the effectiveness of brainstorming as an instructional approach to improve students' geometry performance.\n" +
      "METHODS: The research involved 140 students from two coeducational public secondary schools, with 73 students assigned to an experimental group taught using the brainstorming strategy. In comparison, 67 students were placed in a control group that received instruction through the conventional method. Data were collected using the Geometry Performance Test (GPT) with a reliability coefficient of 0.83 obtained using the test-retest method. The data generated were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics to address the research questions and test the study's hypotheses.\n" +
      'RESULTS: The results indicated that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in posttest scores,   = 227.124,  < 0.001, with a mean score of 66.99 (SD = 9.17) compared to 46.76 (SD = 6.18) in the control group. No significant gender difference was observed in performance gains,   = 1.609,  = 0.213, suggesting that brainstorming is an effective teaching strategy without gender bias.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: These findings show the potential of brainstorming as a powerful tool for improving students' performance in geometry with equitable effectiveness among male and female secondary students. Thus, we recommended that educators should integrate brainstorming into their mathematics classrooms as a proxy to close performance gaps among male and female students in mathematics and improve students' performance in mathematics. As this study was conducted in two public secondary schools in Kaduna State, Nigeria, we acknowledge that the findings are context-specific and may not be generalizable without caution.",

    title: 'Quality-checking a novel "fact sheet" on ghostly episodes.',
    abstract: `INTRODUCTION: 'Apparitions, hauntings, and poltergeists' are universally reported phenomena with significant psychological and social implications. Despite their prevalence, the scientific study of these anomalous experiences remains fragmented, and misinformation is widespread. To address this gap, a resource titled "Fact Sheet: Ghostly Episodes at a Glance" was developed to provide an evidence-based summary for educational and clinical use.\n` +
      "METHODS: This preliminary study evaluated the Fact Sheet's content validity through an AI-based verification procedure. Additionally, we assessed its accessibility, utility, and global favorability among four groups: lay percipients, lay non-percipients (information-seekers), clinical practitioners, and amateur paranormal investigators (information-providers).\n" +
      'RESULTS: The Fact Sheet demonstrated strong content validity, accessibility, usefulness, and favorability across all groups. However, participants suggested refinements to enhance readability and contextual depth. Statistical analysis revealed small but significant differences in global favorability scores, with information-providers more strongly endorsing the resource than information-seekers.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: These findings underscore the importance of scientifically-grounded, accessible resources in educating diverse audiences about anomalous experiences. The study highlights the value of data-driven public education in this domain and offers specific recommendations for improving future iterations of the Fact Sheet to boost engagement and comprehension in both educational and clinical settings.',

    title: 'How does academic self-efficacy influence learning anxiety and academic burnout in Chinese characters learning among international students in China?',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The interplay between learning self-efficacy, anxiety, and burnout has been extensively documented in English as a Second Language (ESL) education. However, Chinese character learning-a uniquely complex task involving visual-spatial processing, stroke order mastery, and radical decomposition-presents distinct cognitive and affective challenges. The dynamics of self-efficacy, anxiety, and burnout in Chinese character acquisition remain under-explored, creating a critical gap in understanding how these constructs operate in non-alphabetic language contexts.\n' +

    title: "The impact of sensory modalities and background information on the emotional resonance of Li Bai's classical poetry.",
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Emotional resonance (ER) refers to the extent to which readers identify with and emotionally connect to the representations in poetry, often drawing parallels between the emotions conveyed in the poem and their own personal experiences. This phenomenon is influenced by sensory modalities-such as visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory-and the cultural context embedded within the poem. Understanding how these factors interact to enhance emotional resonance in poetry is crucial for advancing poetry education and engagement.\n' +
      'METHODS: This study employs a repeated-measures experimental design to investigate how different sensory modalities and contextual background influence emotional responses to classical poetry. The experiment includes five conditions: three focus on sensory modalities (visual, auditory, and visual-auditory), while the remaining two examine the combined effects of background information (background music and background images) in conjunction with sensory modalities.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The results indicate that: The visual modality and the visual-auditory modality yield higher emotional resonance ratings compared to the auditory modality. Background information (background music and images) enhances the emotional resonance of the poetry. The synergy between background information and sensory modalities further increases the emotional resonance ratings.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: This study highlights the critical role of both sensory modalities and background information in shaping the emotional response to poetry. The findings suggest that integrating different sensory experiences and cultural cues can significantly enhance emotional resonance, offering new theoretical insights for the teaching and appreciation of poetry.',

    title: 'The economic strategies of superorganisms.',
    abstract: 'The leaf economics spectrum links strategies of plant investment in resource-acquiring leaves to overall fitness. We test whether an economic spectrum can also explain variation in ecological strategies of ant species across environmental gradients, where colony investment in workers is analogous to plant investment in leaves. A fast return of resource investment was associated with large colonies of smaller, less robust, short-lived workers with low nitrogen:phosphorus ratios. Slow resource payback was associated with small colonies of densely built, energetically conservative and longer-lived workers with high nitrogen:phosphorus ratios. Species representing the entire economic continuum co-occurred in all communities. Phylogenetic analyses suggest genus level conservation of core investment templates. These results unify studies of plants and ants, suggesting common economic principles apply across the tree of life.',
