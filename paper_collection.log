    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +
      'information by constructing and modifying schemas that represent economic\n' +
      'material. Following this approach, we developed a set of instructional\n' +
      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +
      'students to the causal diagrams that explain key economic relationships in the\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'replicated in a within sibling-pair design; (iii) conditional on 1974 outcomes,\n' +
      'higher PGS individuals surveyed in 1975 aspired to higher incomes and more\n' +
      'prestigious jobs 10 years hence, an effect driven primarily by respondents with\n' +
      'more than a high school education; (iv) throughout their employment history,\n' +
      'high PGS individuals were more likely to undertake on the job training, and\n' +
      'more likely to change job duties during tenure with an employer; and (v) though\n' +
      'no more likely to change employers or industries during their careers, high PGS\n' +
      'individuals were more likely in 1974 to be working in industries which would\n' +
      'experience high wage growth in subsequent decades. These results contribute to\n' +

    title: 'A New Index of Human Capital to Predict Economic Growth',
    summary: 'The accumulation of knowledge required to produce economic value is a process\n' +
      'that often relates to nations economic growth. Such a relationship, however, is\n' +
      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

      'started to dwindle in 1990 when nations schooling began to homogenized. We\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +

      'named human capacity. It organizes and amplifies spare time required for\n' +
      'enjoying affluence like physical capital, the technical infrastructure for\n' +
      'production, organizes and amplifies working time for supply. The sum of annual\n' +
      'spare and working time is fixed by the universal flow of time. This yields the\n' +
      'first macroeconomic equilibrium condition. Both storable quantities form\n' +
      'stabilizing feedback loops. They are driven with the general and technical\n' +

    summary: 'The paper presents instructive interdisciplinary applications of constrained\n' +
      'mechanics calculus in economics on a level appropriate for the undergraduate\n' +

      'to enable the students to understand deeper the principles and methods\n' +

    title: 'Surveying Health Professions Students’ Use of Generative AI Applications',
    summary: 'While there has been an explosion of interest in the use of generative AI (GenAI) applications in medical education over the past 2 years, relatively little is understood about how health professions students are using this technology. This study aimed to answer these questions by surveying students about their GenAI use. Unsurprisingly, this survey revealed that many students were indeed using these applications, most often for information retrieval.',

    title: 'The effect of simulation-based breast health education on breast cancer awareness and breast self-examination skills of Afghan refugee women: a randomized controlled trial',
    summary: "Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the effects of simulation-based breast health education on Afghan women's awareness of breast cancer, including knowledge of its risk factors, signs, and symptoms, as well as to improve their breast self-examination skills. Study design This study was a pre-test, post-test, parallel-arm randomized controlled trial. Methods The study sample consisted of 46 Afghan women, with 23 participants assigned to each of the intervention and control groups using block randomization. This study was conducted at the Social Development and Aid Mobilization (SGDD-ASAM) in Ankara, Türkiye. The intervention group received simulation-based breast health training. Each session of breast health education was 180 min. The simulation used a one-to-one show-and-do technique, which took approximately 120 min. Data were collected using the Breast Cancer Awareness Measure and the Breast Self-Examination Skill Assessment Form. The data were analyzed with the IBM SPSS 26 program. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the study data, including mean, standard deviation, percentage, and frequency distribution. The Shapiro–Wilk normality test was applied for further analysis. The Chi-Square (X 2 ) Test was used to compare outcomes between groups. The significance level of p  < 0.05 was considered. Results After the simulation-based training, there was a significant increase in confidence, skills, and behavior awareness among participants in the intervention group compared to the control group ( p  < 0.001). While there was no change in the control group, awareness of breast cancer, knowledge, and skills in the intervention group were predominantly rated as sufficient. Conclusions The simulation-based breast health education intervention for Afghan refugee women was found to be a practical and innovative approach to raising breast cancer awareness and providing breast self-examination skills. This intervention may play a significant role in identifying at-risk individuals and raising their awareness. If sustained, this could potentially increase future screening participation and early detection, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes. It is recommended that policymakers and health professionals prioritize the integration of simulation-based health education into prevention and health promotion strategies targeting disadvantaged populations, such as refugees and migrants, to improve early diagnosis and advance health equity. Trial registration Clinical Trials Number is NCT06051331. Registration date is 22.11.2023.",

    summary: 'This study investigated how proficiency in Somali, Arabic, and English predicts academic success of primary school students within Somaliland’s trilingual educational context. This research addresses a gap in large-scale, data-driven studies using advanced analytics. The study analyzed national examination data from 20,638 students who participated in the 2022/2023 Grade 8 national exams, sourced from the Somaliland National Examination and Certification Board (NECB). Methods included descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, multiple linear regression (MLR), and comparison of ten machine learning (ML) regression models—Linear, Polynomial, Robust, Partial Least Squares (PLS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Principal Component Regression (PCR), Quantile, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Regression. Models were evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE), Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), and Relative Root Squared Error (RRSE) to assess predictive accuracy. Findings showed that proficiency scores in Somali, Arabic, and English were significant positive predictors of overall academic performance, explaining 79.4% of the variance (R 2 ≈ 0.794, F (3, 20,602) = 26,407.88, p < 0.001). English proficiency showed the strongest predictive coefficient (B = 2.34, p < 0.001), followed by Arabic (B = 2.23, p < 0.001), and Somali (B = 1.63, p < 0.001), highlighting their differential impact within the assessment framework. The ML model analysis revealed Polynomial Regression provided the most accurate predictions (lowest MAPE = 8.68%, lowest RRSE = 44.24%), suggesting non-linear relationships between language skills and academic achievement that linear models may not capture. The analysis revealed demographic imbalances, with data predominantly from urban (90.8%) and private school (57.3%) students. Policy implications emphasize enhancing equitable access to language instruction across all three languages, focusing on rural and public school populations; evaluating assessment practices for linguistic fairness; and addressing resource allocation disparities using ML insights for targeted interventions. Future research recommendations include longitudinal studies to explore causality, integrating comprehensive language assessments and socioeconomic data, investigating multilingual classroom practices, applying Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, examining language-demographic interactions, and analyzing subject-specific outcomes.

    title: 'The need for governance in blockchain dispute resolution (BDR): institutional possibilities frontier (IPF) perspective',
    summary: 'Blockchain, as a decentralized ledger technology, has been applied in various domains, including dispute resolution for issues arising from blockchain and smart contract transactions. Blockchain-based dispute resolution platforms claim to operate free from central authority, eschewing traditional procedural and substantive rules. However, these platforms have raised concerns among legal scholars regarding their potential to undermine fundamental rights, prompting calls for governance in blockchain-based dispute resolution (BDR). Allen et al. proposed the Dispute Resolution Possibilities Frontier (DRPF), inspired by the Institutional Possibilities Frontier (IPF) from new comparative economics. The DRPF highlights blockchain’s potential to reduce disorder and dictatorship costs in dispute resolution. This study analyzes BDR processes across the dispute resolution spectrum through normative and doctrinal legal research, further refining the DRPF framework. The analysis reveals that while BDR may increase efficiency, as suggested by Allen et al., by reducing dictatorship and disorder costs up to a certain point, it does not entirely transform the dispute resolution framework. To achieve the loss-minimizing point—where dictatorship and disorder costs are optimized—some form of governance or order is necessary. Consensual methods like negotiation and mediation pose minimal risks, while adjudicative mechanisms, such as self-enforcing crowd voting and on-chain arbitration that enforce outcomes via smart contracts, lack adequate safeguards. To address these challenges, we propose governance strategies that incorporate design elements safeguarding disputants’ rights. By balancing efficiency and fairness, such measures can optimize BDR processes, ensuring they remain effective and compliant with essential legal standards.',

    summary: 'The paper uses the CS-ARDL approach to analyze the impact of institutional quality, economic openness, population growth, and GDP per capita on environmental quality in 12 countries of the MENA region for the period of 1997–2023. We find that institutional quality, economic openness, and environmental quality move together in both the short and long term, but with different speeds of adjustment. The results show that economic openness, population growth, and gross domestic product per capita strongly affect environmental quality in the MENA region. In contrast, economic openness in developed economies has a positive impact on environmental quality in both the short and long term. However, population growth and gross domestic product per capita have a strong impact on environmental quality in both developed and developing countries in the short and long term. Additionally, results for the North and Middle East regions remain robust. The heterogeneity of results for developed, developing, North, and Middle East regions suggests strong policy recommendations for improving the environmental quality to achieve sustainable development.',

    title: 'Comparing surgical outcomes of the semisitting versus lateral position in large vestibular schwannoma surgery: a randomized clinical trial',
    summary: 'The choice between the semisitting position (SSP) and the lateral position (LP) for vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery remains a topic of debate, particularly for large tumors, and high-quality evidence is limited. This study aimed to prospectively determine the optimal surgical position for VS with a diameter of ≥ 3 cm. This analysis is based on a randomized clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of VS surgery in SSP versus LP. Outcomes included the extent of resection, functional results, complications, and health economics. A total of 115 consecutive patients with large VS were prospectively enrolled between December 2019 and November 2023 (SSP: 58, LP: 57). The gross-total resection (GTR) rate was significantly higher in the SSP group compared to the LP group ( P  = 0.026). There was no significant difference in facial nerve (FN) function between the groups 7 days post-operation; however, FN function was superior in the LP group after 1 year. Preoperative preparation duration and craniotomy durations in the SSP group were significantly longer, while overall operative time, tumor resection, and cranial closure durations showed no significant differences between the groups. In terms of health economics, patients in the SSP group had longer hospital stays and higher hospitalization costs. This study demonstrated that SSP offers advantages in achieving higher GTR rates. However, it does not provide any significant benefit in preserving facial nerve function. Given the elevated risks of VAE, SSP should primarily be considered for patients in good physical condition. Furthermore, patients in the SSP group required more extensive preoperative evaluations and intensive monitoring, resulting in longer hospital stays and increased costs. The financial implications of hospitalization should also be taken into account. This study is a registered clinical trial. It was prospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1900027550) on November 17, 2019.',

    summary: 'This article considers religious charities from an original perspective, that of their economic contributions to society as an alternative argument to those who wish to see religious charities struck from the charity sector. This is timely because of recent national and international changes to charity law legislation and policies. In essence, the article has demonstrated that religious charities contribute significantly in economic terms to New Zealand society generally, and further, measuring the public benefit of religious charities through an economic lens may assist in determining the differing ways in which religious charities contribute to, and benefit, society.',

    summary: 'The adoption of new technologies often concerns a range of people across and around higher education (HE) institutions, spurring the need for various, possibly dissenting voices to be heard. This paper explores the complexity of this issue through the concept of postdigital dissensus. I examine how sociotechnical stances and discourses regarding digitalisation and artificial intelligence (AI) in HE relate to dissensus and lack of sociotechnical closure. I argue that technology perceptions in HE are diversified beyond easily resolvable differences such as educators’ competences or presumptions. Rather, a more complex and nuanced perspective is needed to recognise and work with postdigital dissensus. Drawing on constructivist and critical theories of technology and recent literature on issues in technology adoption in HE, I examine what may constitute ‘points of dissensus’ regarding digitalisation of HE. The complexity of postdigital dissensus is illustrated through the concepts of asymmetries in knowledge, domains and scales, roles and standpoints, expectations and metanarratives. I argue the need to construct fuller theories of the nature and dynamics of postdigital dissensus, as well as to utilise explicitly future-oriented, imaginative and collective working methods to engage in multi-voice discussions around digitalisation.',

    summary: 'The integration of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity presents new opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship, yet traditional educational approaches often lack the interdisciplinary and applied focus required to develop these competencies. This study evaluates the impact of an experiential learning workshop that integrated IoT prototyping, AI-based anomaly detection, and cybersecurity principles to promote technical understanding, entrepreneurial thinking, and ethical awareness. Conducted at Godfrey Okoye University, Nigeria, the workshop engaged 476 undergraduate students from diverse academic disciplines in project-based learning activities and collaborative design challenges. Statistical analysis of matched pre- and post-assessments revealed a mean increase of 25.5 percentage points (95% confidence intervals $$\\pm 4.2\\%$$ ± 4.2 % , $$p < 0.001$$ p < 0.001 ) in quiz performance across all three domains. Regression and exploratory mediation analysis indicated that prior knowledge and engagement with hands-on tasks were significant predictors of learning gains. Qualitative feedback highlighted the perceived value of real-world application, teamwork, and ethical reflection. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of experiential and interdisciplinary educational models in fostering future-ready skills and responsible innovation. This study offers actionable guidance for designing inclusive, scalable technology learning interventions and contributes to advancing Sustainable Development Goal 4 on equitable quality education.',

    title: 'Speed of Processing Training for Stress Adaptation in Caregivers of a Family Member With Dementia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The chronic stress of caregiving for a family member with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is associated with a host of health risks, including accelerated cognitive aging and poor emotional well-being. Despite known links between cognitive and emotion regulatory pathways, cognitive training has not been tested in ADRD caregivers as a means to strengthen cognitive capacity and concomitant emotion regulation, domains undergirding stress adaptation. This study aimed to identify effects of computerized cognitive training on cognitive and emotion indicators of caregivers' capacity for stress adaptation, a key mechanism for healthy aging.\n" +
      'RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: ADRD family caregivers ( = 195; ages 55-85 years) enrolled in a 2-arm randomized controlled trial were assigned (1:1) to engage in a vision-based speed of processing and attention (VSOP/A) training or video education (VE). Processing speed and attention, working memory under stress, and emotion reactivity to laboratory and caregiving stressors were measured at baseline, following an 8-week intervention, and 6 months and 12 months postintervention. Intent-to-treat analyses using mixed models for repeated measures tested effects of VSOP/A training on these outcomes.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The VSOP/A group had significantly improved processing speed and attention performance compared to the VE group, and these differences persisted through 6 months postintervention. At 6 months postintervention only, working memory performance under stress was significantly better among the VSOP/A compared to VE group. At 12 months, caregivers in the VSOP/A group reported less negative emotion in response to ADRD-related behavioral symptoms of their care recipient. There were no group differences in acute emotion reactivity to the laboratory stressor at any time point.\n' +
      "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings from this study suggest that targeted cognitive training should be further developed as an efficacious strategy to strengthen ADRD family caregivers' stress adaptation capacity and healthy aging.  NCT03036423.",

This phenomenon flourishes in environments of optimism and nurturance, where staff engage authentically, fostering supportive and non-judgmental relationships. By embracing a strength-based approach, these spaces become welcoming and enhance well-being. Emergent adults with social and mental health issues need ongoing and personalized support that emphasizes peer interactions and focuses on building self-belief and social skills, beyond job opportunities.",

    title: 'Social jet lag is associated with core symptoms in 2-3-year-old children with autism spectrum disorders.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Social jet lag (SJL) is a form of circadian rhythm misalignment caused by the mismatch between social schedules and biological clocks, which is associated with cognition, behavior, and emotion in children. However, social jet lag among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and its impacts are unknown.\n' +
      "METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 2-7-year-old children with ASD from special education institutions and outpatient clinics. The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) assessed children's sleep. SJL was calculated as |weekend sleep midpoint - weekday sleep midpoint|. Sleep adequacy was determined based on the National Sleep Foundation's recommendations. Core symptoms were evaluated using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC). Developmental level was assessed using the Gesell Developmental Scale.\n" +
      'RESULTS: 1) The prevalence of sleep problems was 49.8% and the mean CSHQ total score was 48.04 in ASD. There are significant differences in sleep patterns between weekends and weekdays, characterized by later bedtimes, delayed wake-up times, increased total sleep duration, and reduced prevalence of sleep deficiency during weekends. 2) The 2-3-year-old group had the highest rates of sleep insufficiency (80.77% on weekdays; 82.17% on weekends). There were no significant differences in sleep duration across different age groups, with the median sleep duration ranging from 9.5 to 10 hours. 3) Median SJL in each age group was 0.25 h (2-3 years), 0.5 h (3-4 years), 0.42 h (4-5 years), and 0.5 h (≥5 years), respectively. In children aged 2-3 years, SJL was significantly positively correlated with core symptoms 4) SJL was observed to be weakly associated with developmental level of personal-social only in the ≥ 3-year-old group ( = 0.100,  = 0.042).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Our study found for the first time a correlation between SJL and core symptoms in 2-3-year-old children with ASD. This finding suggests that SJL may have a potentially negative impact on core symptoms in ASD. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of regular routines for ASD, especially in younger children.',

    title: 'Psychometric Properties of the Barriers to and Facilitators of Implementing the Sepsis Six Care Bundle (BLISS-1) Questionnaire.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a severe medical condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, accounts for 20% of global fatalities. While simplifying early sepsis treatment with the Sepsis Six care bundle has been shown to reduce mortality by 46.6%, multiple barriers often prevent clinical nurses from adhering to sepsis care recommendations. Identifying these barriers is essential to eliminating them, and thus the Sepsis Six Care bundle (BLISS-1) questionnaire was developed to identify the barriers to and facilitators of nurses' implementation of the Sepsis Six care bundle while caring for sepsis patients. The current study assessed the psychometric properties of the BLISS-1 questionnaire to evaluate its validity and reliability.\n" +
      'PURPOSE: This study assessed the psychometric properties of the BLISS-1 questionnaire.\n' +
      "METHODS: A total of 180 clinical nurses working in different critical care units at a selected University Hospital participated in a cross-sectional, descriptive study. Data were collected using the BLISS-1 Questionnaire, used to assess the perceived barriers to and facilitators of Sepsis Six performance. Descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis, and Promax rotation EFA were performed to assess the validity and reliability of the questionnaire.\n" +
      "RESULTS: The BLISS-1 questionnaire has strong internal consistency, with Cronbach's alpha values of 0.978 for perceived barriers and 0.976 for perceived importance. Factor analysis revealed that key barriers included skepticism about the protocol's clinical efficacy and operational challenges such as limited training and insufficient resources.\n" +
      "CONCLUSION: This study revealed the BLISS-1 questionnaire to be highly reliable. Focused education, appropriate resource allocation, and supporting policies are needed to increase nurses' adherence to the Sepsis Six protocol and, hence, improve patient outcomes.",

    title: 'Characterizing the Optimal Diversity Training Programs for Physicians: A Survey sponsored by Pacific Spine and Pain Society.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Recently, increasing research has shown inferior outcomes in patients with respect to specific social determinants of health. Therefore, optimizing diversity training given to pain management providers is imperative for physicians to provide culturally competent healthcare and to improve patient outcomes. In this paper, we attempt to describe trends in the Pacific Spine and Pain Society (PSPS) membership to help discover optimal diversity education paradigms for pain management providers by performing a survey on behalf PSPS.\n' +
      "METHODS: A survey was disseminated to all members of the PSPS at the 2022 annual meeting. Opinions were solicited with respect to respondents' demographics, diversity training type, diversity training timing, and how this correlates with a respondent's self-reported confidence in navigating diversity issues in the workplace. Cronbach's alpha test was used to rate internal consistency while logistic regression models were used for statistical analysis.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha produced a rating of 0.91.

    title: 'Examining the Effects of Interventional Pain Management Staff Controlled Substance Agreement Education for Patients with Chronic Non-Cancer Intrathecal Drug Delivery Device Opioid Therapy: A Retrospective Review.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDS) are effective tools for the management of chronic non-cancer pain, cancer-associated pain, and spasticity. Given the overall risks of opioid medications, it is imperative that IDDS opioid-infusion patients receive education regarding the risks versus benefits of their intrathecal opioid medications and that controlled substance agreements (CSAs) are utilized to both educate patients and hold them accountable for keeping IDDS programming visits, refill appointments, or other IDDS maintenance appointments.\n' +
      'METHODS: A retrospective electronic medical record (EMR) review study was conducted at an interventional pain management practice, quantifying the number of non-cancer chronic pain IDDS opioid therapy patients with signed CSAs. An educational intervention was conducted to increase staff awareness regarding compliance with CSAs and the location of proper CSA documentation within the EMR. Follow-up EMR review and provider knowledge assessment surveys were deployed to assess the success of the intervention.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Staff knowledge of CSAs increased from 14.3% (3/21) to 45.5% (10/22) following CSA education while their ability to locate CSAs within the EMR also increased from 38.1% (8/21) to 40.9% (9/22). Post-education intervention, rates of CSA documentation improved from 4.5% to 74.5%. Lastly, there was a 39.5% reduction in rescheduled IDDS appointments within the patient population studied.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest potentially profound impacts that a simple education intervention can have on staff knowledge and compliance with CSA documentation for patients receiving IDDS opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Furthermore, implementation of CSAs for this patient population may be associated with a decrease in the number of missed, no-show, or rescheduled IDDS maintenance appointments, which have important patient safety implications. Further research is warranted to investigate the impact of CSA compliance on adverse patient outcomes and the potential cost-savings practices with required CSAs.',

Despite limitations and a continued preference for in-person visits among some patients, telemedicine can be a valuable tool for musculoskeletal health practitioners, offering new ways to deliver high-quality, timely, and cost-effective care.",
