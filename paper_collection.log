    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'Mothers’ duties and rights when positioned as remote education tutors in Australian distance schooling',
    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Public management of digitalization into the Spanish tourism services: a heterodox analysis',
    summary: "This study is a critical review of public intervention and its management of change with digitalization, applied to Spanish tourism services, as ones of the largest case and most required of attention into the European Union. In comparison with other mainstream papers, this heterodox review is based on the combination of Austrian Economics and Neo-Institutional approaches ( Cornucopists ), with their common theoretical and methodological frameworks. Thus, it is possible to analyze failures and paradoxes in the public intervention, especially with post-COVID recovery policies. The case of the Spanish tourism sector highlights the effect of double bureaucracy, from European institutions and the Spanish Government, affecting its competitiveness and revealing the confirmation of heterodox theorems. Faced with mainstream public intervention guidelines, which usually involve expansive spending and more debt (and New-Malthusian measures), a heterodox mainline solution is offered here, based on the revival of the original sustainability principle, the readjustment effect and the promotion of geek'n'talent education, to facilitate the transition to the Knowledge Economy, where the tourism sector is capable of offering personalized travel experiences due to digitalization.",

    title: 'In pursuit of equity in upper secondary education: the curious case of Ghana’s free senior high school policy',
    summary: 'The Free Senior High School policy is Ghana’s attempt at actualising the SDG 4 global consensus on free upper secondary education. Using grounded theory method, this research scrutinises the Free SHS 2018 policy and strategy document, alongside interviews with policymakers, to answer the question: How does the equity provision ensure fairness in upper secondary education, and what equity blind spots exist? Specifically, the study employed a purposive sampling technique, allowing for the deliberate selection of data sources that ensured the collection of focused, meaningful data aligned with the research goals. The findings underscore a disconnect between the policy’s equity intentions and solutions. For example, the policy highlights that, intersectional differences—such as economic, school-based, gender, and regional factors—persist and drive inequitable access. However, these issues are inadequately addressed because the policy applies cookie-cutter-style economic solutions to all inequity concerns. Policymakers from within, and outside from government, hold diverse perspectives on the impact of this disconnect on sub-populations. The former underscores political and technical accountabilities where increasing numbers of enrolment are equated to equity, while the latter underscores differential policy effect sizes on sub-population to mean inequity. Curiously, the policy has improved access despite the equity conundrum, weak economy, lack of private–public initiatives, declining GDP allocation to education, no selective fee waivers, and neglect of secondary education expansion prerequisites. The paper advocates realigning the policy’s equity dimension with its equity goals.',

    title: 'A phenomenological reading of integration in the longitudinal integrated clerkship',
    summary: 'This paper reports on a phenomenological reading of integration in education programs, through three layers of specificity: (1) broadly, on integration as an educational idea; (2) more particularly, on integration as expressed in the program model of the longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC); and (3) with the highest degree of specificity, on integration ‘at work’ in an actual LIC program. Each layer of penetration found different aspects of the phenomenological nature of integration. A further integrative leap across these aspects phenomenologically revealed four essential qualities of integration, being: integration transforms parts into wholes; integration’s animating locus is mutable, mobile and multiple; integration is already at work and is sustained through possibility; and integration holds open for ‘more’ integration. By appreciating integration for its essential qualities, this research adds foundational value to the literature on educational integration, and opens new questions about how we, as educators, might deliberately work with both its presence and its promise in our educational pedagogies, practices and programs.',

    title: 'The positioning of quality and expertise in initial teacher education: policy enactment in the Australian context',
    summary: 'Teacher quality and teacher education improvement have been central discourses for at least two decades in global education. In Australia, despite the pervasive nature of these discussions, there is a lack of substantial evidence indicating the existence of a problem in this regard. Policies aimed at enhancing the ‘preparedness’ of teacher graduates and elevating the ‘quality’ of ITE programs have nonetheless emerged as prevalent solutions over the past decade. The latest enactment of reforms in the policy chain is the Strong Beginnings report from the Teacher Education Expert Panel. In this paper, we align with Ball’s perspective that policy should be viewed as a dynamic process rather than a presumed, ready-made solution to a problem. We utilise systematic conceptual coding using Leximancer to enable a nuanced exploration of the understandings, practices, and conditions of influence for the policy actors inscribed in the TEEP report. We also analyse concept frequency and collocation in the final Strong Beginnings report, noting two main propositions: first, that there is a problem with quality in ITE; and second, that practice is foregrounded in professionalisation. We highlight the consistencies and contradictions within the discourses of the final report and the submissions from policy actors that contributed to this policy enactment process. We suggest that evidence is used when it suits a policy position, but ignored if it disrupts the platform position. We conclude by arguing that the policy actors in this policy enactment process should be afforded the professional authority to continue a well-established process of continual improvement.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    summary: 'In this paper, we suggest that poetic inquiry offers a pathway for capturing the deeply felt, personal dimensions of ongoing identity growth of initial teacher educators of professional experience. We propose that poetic inquiry provides an avenue for authentically sharing experiences and insights into caring and being cared for, diverging from conventional academic narratives. Through poetic self-reflection and collective poetic representation, we can uncover and navigate the subtle tensions shaping our identity journey, fostering a communal understanding of the teacher educator’s role within the contexts of Australian higher education and initial teacher education.',

    title: 'Studying Year 6 students’ perceptions of gender and their engagement in STEM within an Australian primary school',
    summary: 'Gender stereotypes—and performances of femininity and masculinity—play a key role in how and why an individual engages in STEM education. Students’ perceptions of STEM have been carefully and consistently studied in high school and in tertiary education contexts, but to date there has been limited research examining students’ gendered perceptions of STEM at the primary school level. This small case study adopts a critical feminist approach and draws on classroom observations and semi-structured focus group interviews using photo-elicitation to foreground student voice. The aim of this research is to uncover how Year 6 students (n = 6) living and learning in Australia perceive STEM as a gendered discipline of study. Drawing on an inductive thematic analysis, we identified key differences between boys and girls which arguably have implications for their engagement in STEM. Our analysis foregrounds the role of (1) self-efficacy; (2) social pressures and performativity; and (3) pervasive gender norms, which all played a role in influencing students’ identities. We then consider the implications of these findings for educators. The article concludes with an examination of the limitations of the study as well as considerations for future research.',

    title: 'Embedding Health-Related Social Needs Screening and Resource Navigation in a U.S. Forensic Asylum Clinic: A Pilot Intervention.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Despite increased focus on social determinants of health, little is known about screening and intervention for asylum seekers, a highly marginalized group. We present the feasibility of a pilot social needs screening and resource navigation program at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Asylum Clinic in Boston, Massachusetts.\n' +
      'METHODS: Clinicians and staff referred patients who had a forensic evaluation in the clinic for screening. We screened across ten domains: (1) Housing and utilities, (2) Food security, (3) Access to healthcare, (4) Transportation, (5) Education/ Literacy, (6) Employment, (7) Childcare, (8) Disability/Disabling conditions, (9) Psychosocial well-being, and (10) Personal safety.\n' +
      'RESULTS: From April 2021 to June 2022, we evaluated 118 patients in the clinic. Twenty-eight (24%) completed screening. Their average age was 35.5 years (range = 18-67) and 50% were men. They came from 11 countries, with Uganda (25%), Cameroon (14%), El Salvador (14%), and Ecuador (14%) most represented. Most common needs were access to healthcare (86%), employment (46%), psychosocial wellbeing (43%), and education (43%). Applicants also typically screened positive for multiple domains (mean = 3.3, SD = 2.2, range = 1-8 domains).\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: Our pilot social needs screening and resource navigation program in an academic asylum clinic demonstrates the model's feasibility. Future studies should explore patient experiences and outcomes following referral.",

    title: 'Improvement of sports nutrition knowledge by a dual method education program in track and field athletes: a randomized controlled trial.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Athletes with strong sports nutrition knowledge are believed to have sound nutritional practices and better performance. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a dual-method personalized nutrition education program in improving sports nutrition knowledge (SNK) among Sri Lankan track and field athletes.\n' +
      'METHODS: This parallel-group, randomized controlled trial recruited national-level track and field athletes aged 18 and above. The intervention group (IG) received personalized sports nutrition consultations at 0, 4, and 8 weeks, along with online educational materials via WhatsApp from weeks 10 to 16, while the control group (CG) did not receive any intervention. A per-protocol analysis was followed, and t-tests were used to compare the means.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Of the 30 participants enrolled, 13 from IG and 14 from CG completed the study. Following the 16-week intervention, the IG demonstrated significant improvements in total nutrition knowledge (TNK) relative to the CG (IG: 34.41 ± 4.15 vs. CG: 20.96 ± 4.38;  = 0.01), with significant increases in general nutrition knowledge (GNK) (IG:24.54 ± 3.66 vs. CG:15.64 ± 2.33;  = 0.004) and SNK (9.87 ± 3.87 vs. 5.32 ± 4.07;  = 0.006). Changes in TNK were also significantly greater in the IG compared to the CG; (IG:9.45 ± 0.10 vs. CG: -2.63 ± 0.37;  < 0.0001), GNK (IG:4.47 ± 0.08 vs. CG: -1.28 ± 0.09;  < 0.0001), and SNK (IG:4.99 ± 0.72 vs. CG: -1.25 ± 0.74;  < 0.0001).\n' +

    title: 'EXPRESS: Large Language Model Content Detectors: Effects of Human Editing and ChatGPT Mimicking Individual Style - A Preliminary Study.',
    abstract: "The use of large language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, in academic writing is increasing, but the extent to which LLM-generated content can evade detection remains unclear. This descriptive pilot study investigates whether LLM-generated abstracts, edited by humans or LLM trained to mimic a specific writing style, can escape LLM detectors. Using a previously published original article, ChatGPT-4 generated an abstract (Abstract 1). This abstract underwent three modifications: context-based human editing (Abstract 2), stylistic human editing (Abstract 3), and ChatGPT editing incorporating the author's writing style (Abstract 4). The genuine human-written abstract from the original article served as Abstract 5. Five freely available LLM detectors analyzed these abstracts, providing LLM-generated probability scores. The genuinely LLM-generated manuscript (Abstract 1) was judged as LLM-generated with 82~100% (median: 100%) probability. The genuinely human-written manuscript (Abstract 5) was judged as human-written with the LLM-generated probability of 0~13% (median: 0%). Human-edited abstracts (Abstracts 2 and 3) exhibited a decreasing LLM-generated probability 4~71% (median: 64%) and 2~65% (median: 61%), respectively, but varied widely among detectors. The LLM-mimicked abstract (Abstract 4) was classified as LLM-generated, with LLM-generated probability ranging 82~100% (median: 100%). The results showed variations across different LLM detectors. Supplementary experiments demonstrated a similar trend. Human editing reduces LLM-detection probabilities but does not guarantee evasion. LLM-generated content mimicking a specific writing style remains largely detectable. This preliminary experiment provided a novel study concept. Further studies on various manuscripts and different LLM detection methods will enhance understanding of the relationship between LLM-aided paper writing and LLM detectors.",

    abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Endometrial cancer incidence and mortality disproportionately affect Black patients, and delayed diagnosis is a contributor. Providers in multiple settings share the task of endometrial cancer diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to elicit physician perspectives on national guidelines for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer (EC), understanding of racial disparities in EC, and to explore physician receptivity to a risk-based, endometrial biopsy (EMB)-first approach of peri/postmenopausal bleeding.\n' +
      'METHODS: We performed semi-structured interviews with 12 U.S. physicians across multiple specialties. Interview structure was developed and refined using an iterative process. We used inductive reasoning to employ exploratory content analysis.\n' +
      'RESULTS: We interviewed OB/Gyn (n = 4), family medicine (n = 3), internal medicine n = 3), and emergency medicine (n = 2) physicians in all regions of the U.S. Slightly over half (58%) performed EMB. Most (58%) were uncertain about guidelines for diagnosis. Nearly half (42%) reported lack of knowledge regarding racial disparities in EC diagnosis and cancer outcomes. OB/Gyn physicians were skeptical of guideline efficacy in high-risk patients, including patients identifying as Black. Most (75%) physicians supported a risk-based, biopsy-first approach to diagnosis of EC.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Physicians caring for patients at risk for EC lack knowledge of current guidelines and of racial disparities in endometrial cancer diagnosis and outcomes. A multi-pronged approach, incorporating changes to national guidelines and targeted provider education, is necessary to eliminate inequities in diagnosis of EC.',

    title: 'Depression, antidepressant use, and breast cancer incidence: results from the E3N prospective cohort.',
    abstract: 'AIM: Depression and antidepressant drugs may both impact breast cancer incidence, potentially in opposite directions. The few epidemiological studies attempting to disentangle their effects have been inconclusive. We aimed to assess within the same prospective cohort the association between depression, antidepressant use, and breast cancer risk, while controlling for potential confounders.\n' +
      "METHODS: The study population included 47,791 women from the E3N (Etude Epidémiologique Auprès de Femmes de la Mutuelle Générale de l'Education Nationale) prospective cohort, born between 1925 and 1950 and followed for breast cancer incidence from 2005 to 2014. Depression was defined by a Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) score ≥17. Exposure to antidepressants was identified from drug claims data available from 2004 onwards. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for invasive breast cancer were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for breast cancer risk factors. Antidepressant exposure was time-varying.\n" +
      'RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 7.2 years, 1365 breast cancers occurred. Depression was associated with a higher incidence of breast cancer (HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.01-1.29]), while exposure to antidepressants was associated with a lower risk (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74-0.98]). No association was observed for treatment durations <6 months (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.79-1.32]), while antidepressant use for at least 24 months was associated with an HR of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.64-0.99).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: These findings from a prospective cohort suggest that depression and antidepressant drugs exert opposing effects on breast cancer incidence. While these results require replication in future studies, they could help promote adherence to antidepressant drugs in women with depression.',

    title: 'Enhancing Thoracic Robotic Surgery Education in the Digital Realm: A Learner Analysis.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: This study examines the role of virtual learning environments (VLEs) in teaching thoracic robotic surgery skills to surgical trainees. It focuses on how an e-module by the Royal College of Surgeons of England aids in acquiring these skills.\n' +
      "METHODS: The study involved 360 participants, including surgical specialty trainees and surgical consultants from various specialties. The e-module, a self-paced, self-contained unit, enhances learning through videos, interactive elements, reflective questions, and case studies. It includes formative and summative assessments with short answer and multiple-choice questions. Using a mixed-method approach, this research combines qualitative interviews and questionnaires with quantitative statistical analysis, grounded in Knowles' theory of andragogy, to assess the e-module's alignment with adult learning characteristics like self-directedness and motivation.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Results show strong positive correlations between e-module use and educational alignment. Participants' scores on multiple-choice questions improved from 60% premodule to 75% postmodule (  = 6.32,  < .001). There was a strong positive correlation ( = 0.7) between frequent virtual training sessions and alignment with trainees' educational needs. Analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences based on prior experience (  = 4.56,  = .013).\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the transformative potential of VLEs in adult education, particularly for thoracic robotic surgery. VLEs address learner needs, promote self-directed learning, and foster intrinsic motivation, paving the way for enhanced surgical education.

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Non-nutritive suck (NNS) is a measure of neurofunction sensitive to environmental exposures in utero. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between gestational phenol exposure and NNS patterning.\n' +
      'METHODS: Mother-infant pairs from two diverse prospective cohorts were enrolled in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes Program. Phenols were measured in prenatal maternal urine samples and adjusted for specific gravity. NNS was sampled in 1-8-week-old infants using a custom pacifier for ~5 minutes. Associations of 11 phenols and triclocarban with 5 NNS outcomes were assessed individually and as a mixture using generalized linear models adjusted for cohort, child sex and assessment age, and maternal age and education.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Altogether, 215 mother-infant pairs were included. Bisphenol-F was related to a lower NNS frequency. Triclosan was associated with a higher NNS frequency. Propylparaben, 2,4-dichlorophenol, and 2,5-dichlorophenol were associated with lower NNS amplitude. Benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol, and 2,5-dichlorophenol were related to more NNS bursts/minute. Propylparaben was associated with more NNS cycles/bursts. Seven phenols were included in mixture analyses: 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol, benzophenone-3, bisphenol-A, bisphenol-S, methylparaben, and propylparaben. Both Bayesian kernel machine regression and quantile g-computation showed that higher concentrations of the mixture were associated with lower amplitude but more bursts/minute and cycles/burst. Propylparaben was important in the overall mixture effect on amplitude, whereas benzophenone-3 was important in the relationship with bursts/minute.\n' +

    title: 'Perceptions, availability and use of vasopressors for septic shock in emergency care settings in Tanzania.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Sepsis carries a disproportionately high mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. Current international guidelines for management of septic shock advocate for initial fluid resuscitation followed by vasopressors if there is ongoing concern for hypoperfusion. Emerging data suggest patients in sub-Saharan Africa who receives large fluid boluses may have increased mortality and thus earlier initiation of vasopressors may have clinical benefit. Little data exists on the perceptions, availability and use of vasopressors in Tanzania, which may impact the feasibility of this strategy. We aimed to describe the perception, availability and use of vasopressor in Tanzanian emergency care settings, including its barriers.\n' +
      'METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey among clinicians and nurses from 19 different hospitals throughout Tanzania (national, zonal, regional and district hospitals). Collected data was kept by the principal investigator on a password encrypted computer whereby descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Sixty-five healthcare providers completed the survey of whom the majority 53 (81.5 %), work in the emergency medicine department and 50 (76.9 %) reported treating at least one patient with septic shock per week. However, three quarters of respondents from district hospitals and nearly half of those from regional hospitals had access to vasopressors in <50 % of the time. The most common reported barriers to vasopressor use were lack of availability (50.8 %), and lack of comfort or knowledge (43.1 %). Overall, most respondents perceived that vasopressor use is generally safe and helpful for treating septic shock.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all Tanzanian healthcare providers in emergency care settings reported that they had limited access to vasopressors to treat septic shock, as it was not consistently available. In addition to unavailability, lack of knowledge on vasopressor use was also reported as barrier. Our findings suggest that ensuring availability of vasopressors and education in the use thereof would improve sepsis care in Tanzanian hospitals.',

    title: "The Relationship Between Parenting Stress and Parents' Level of Education, Knowledge, and Attitude Regarding Dental and Oral Health Maintenance in Children with Intellectual Disabilities.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Parenting stress is an unpleasant psychological reaction to the demands of being a parent. It affects parents who raise children with developmental disabilities and presents unique challenges, the impact of which is exacerbated by socio-economic status, age, income, and parental education level. Individuals with intellectual disabilities have poorer general health and oral hygiene compared to the general population. Parenting stress can influence parents' knowledge and attitudes about maintaining oral health. This research aimed to determine whether there was a relationship between parenting stress and the level of education, knowledge, and attitudes of parents toward maintaining oral health in children with intellectual disabilities.\n" +
      "METHODS: This research used a cross-sectional analytical method.

    title: 'Exploring determinants of time to school re-entry after pediatric epilepsy surgery.',
    abstract: "After epilepsy surgery, it varies when children re-enter school. The aim of this study was to identify determinants for this variation. Parents of 21 school-attending children participated in semi-structured interviews during their child's hospitalization for epilepsy surgery and one year afterward (based on the standard neuropsychological post-surgical follow-up). The mean time to school re-entry was 10.7 weeks (SD = 6.3). One child did not attend school after one year, whilst the fastest child resumed school 2 weeks after surgery. We performed univariable linear regression models with bootstrapped R for all variables deemed theoretically or clinically relevant to school re-entry. We found that temporal surgery was significantly related to shorter time to school re-entry; and that longer hospitalization, and presurgical outpatient educational counseling were significantly related to longer time to school re-entry. In multivariable linear regression, these variables together predicted 57% of variance (bootstrapped) in time to school re-entry. In conclusion, our findings indicate that school re-entry varies considerably among children but can partly be explained by surgery related variables and the presence of counseling. Given the importance of school in children's daily lives, we argue that school attendance should be stimulated by increasing professionals' awareness of children's school re-entry process.",
