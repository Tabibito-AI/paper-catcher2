    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Economics students’ behavioural intention and usage of ChatGPT in higher education: a hybrid structural equation modelling-artificial neural network approach',
    abstract: 'Abstract The Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, popularly referred to as ChatGPT, is an AI-based technology with the potential to revolutionise conventional teaching and learning in higher education institutions (HEIs). However, it remains unclear which factors influence the behavioural intentions and the actual usage of ChatGPT among economics students in Ghanaian HEIs. In pursuit of this goal, we employed the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) to gain a better understanding of the antecedents influencing the behavioural intentions and actual usage of ChatGPT among economics students. The study surveyed 306 Ghanaian students enrolled in economics at a public university. These students were aware of the existence of ChatGPT applications. We applied a hybrid analytical approach, combining structural equation modelling and artificial neural network (SEM-ANN), to elucidate the causal relationships between variables believed to impact perceived trust, intentions, and actual usage. The results showed that design and interactivity have a significant impact on perceived trust. Similarly, perceived trust, social influence, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habits drive behavioural intentions. Among the various factors influencing behavioural intentions, hedonic motivation emerged as the most dominant. Moreover, behavioural intentions and facilitating conditions significantly drive students’ actual use of the ChatGPT. Nevertheless, ethics is not a significant factor in perceived trust, and effort expectancy does not affect behavioral intention. These findings, however, offer theoretical and practical contributions that can serve as guide for a thoughtful and responsible integration of AI-based tools as a future strategy to enhance education accessibility and inclusivity opportunities',

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'The Future of Accounting Education Under the Developments in AI',
    summary: 'The development of science depends on the basics and principles of Science and scientific research in this science or field, and due to the fact that the nature of the science and field of accounting is developing and improving continuously and rapidly associated with many relationships and fields under many variables and factors, and then this research deals with difficulties between the three variables represented in scientific research, accounting education, and AI, specifically under of the widespread reliance on the preparation and preparation of scientific research using many advanced methods of AI, and then increasing the connection between and the development provided by scientific research. Accounting science and what is repeated in different formats follow the methods of AI. The research also aims to clarify the relationship between AI, accounting education, and accounting scientific research by conducting a questionnaire on a sample of 84 university professors and researchers in the field of accounting. The statistical analysis of the data collected by applying SPSS 25. It was concluded that the relationship between the three variables is considered close and interconnected. Without the first (accounting education), the development of the second (accounting scientific research) stops, which is considered inappropriate for the current business environment in all its categories, whether teaching or learning. Both scientific research and accounting education depend on the latter (AI) to provide technical and analytical support and classify opinions to reduce repetition and avoid deficiencies in the feasibility of research in accounting education.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Predicting Performance in a Military Hand-to-Hand Combat Course From Salivary Hormones, Psychological State, and Academic Performance.',
    abstract: "There are limited opportunities to study physiological and psychological factors that predict success in real world high stress environments where individuals must engage in controlled aggressive behaviour. All cadets attending the United States Military Academy must take a combatives course where they are taught to compete in hand-to-hand combat with peers and graded on performance. This study assessed, in this highly competitive environment, the physiological, psychological, and academic predictors of success in the course's final exam, a final hand-to-hand combat match. Male (n = 109) and female (n = 23) cadets completed self-report assessments of resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale; CD-RISC), mental toughness (Mental Toughness Questionnaire; MTQ-10), and aggression (Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire; BPAQ) upon enrolment in Combatives. Immediately preceding the final match, cadets provided saliva samples and completed mood state (Profile of Mood States; POMS), self-confidence and competitive state anxiety (Competitive State Anxiety Inventory; CSAI-2) questionnaires. Cortisol, testosterone, and secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) in saliva were assessed. Instructors provided match outcome, win versus loss, and each cadet's grade point averages (GPA; academic, military, and physical). Logistic regression analyses determined if physiological, psychological, or academic variables predicted match outcome. Sex, time of day, prior combatives experience, and midterm combatives performance were included as covariates. Greater self-confidence (OR [95% CI]; 1.13 [1.03, 1.25]) and a better physical GPA (4.51 [1.52, 13.42]) were associated with increased odds of winning the final match, with an overall classification accuracy of 68.9% and explained 31% of the variance in match outcome. Greater cognitive anxiety independently decreased the odds of winning (0.93 [0.87, 0.99]), but not when combined with self-confidence and physical GPA. No other factors significantly impacted odds of winning. Self-confidence and physical performance are key contributors to success in hand-to-hand combat and may mediate the influence of anxiety on performance.",

    title: `Evaluating Ontario's High Priority Communities Strategy: Integrating Care, Redressing Health Inequities and Improving Population Health "From the Ground Up".`,
    abstract: 'The COVID-19 pandemic revealed profound inequities in the health of Canadians: racially diverse, newcomer and low-income communities were most likely to experience illness and death. In December 2020, Ontario announced the High Priority Communities Strategy (HPCS) that funded "lead agencies" in 17 marginalized communities to support scores of community partners who in turn devised culturally appropriate "micro-strategies" to provide education, tests, vaccinations and wrap-around care. We draw on evaluations conducted over three years to assess the HPCS and synthesize lessons learned for integrating care, reducing health inequities and improving population health from the "ground up." These lessons are all the more important post the COVID-19 pandemic as health inequities worsen and the healthcare system faces intersecting crises.',

    title: 'Undergraduate Medical Education Addressing Stigmatizing Language Surrounding Mental Health and Addiction: A Systematic Review.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Stigma continues to be a barrier to accessing quality care for many patients with mental health conditions and/or substance use disorder (SUD), commonly referred to as addiction. This paper aims to evaluate the impact that undergraduate medical education (UME) has in reducing stigmatizing language use and potentially mitigating this barrier to care.\n' +
      'METHODS: A systematic review conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines identified 2017 articles across 7 databases. Search terms related to stigma surrounding mental health, addiction, and suicide were incorporated into medical education. Blinded, double-reviewed papers meeting the inclusion criteria were further evaluated at full length to obtain information including sample size, variables, and outcomes.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Three studies met the review's selection criteria: 1 pretest/posttest case series, 1 survey evaluating language stigma, and 1 qualitative essay review to discover common themes in medical students' experience with patients with SUD. Statistically significant results included changes in characteristic association, attitudes based on language, and the effects of an educational intervention.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: These results reinforce the importance of language and educational exposure in addressing stigma toward patients with mental health diagnoses. Although the results of all studies indicated some level of stigma associated with patients with a mental health diagnosis, there was limited consensus surrounding methods to reduce it in UME. Additional research on the implementation of medical school-focused mental health awareness programs is needed, preferably using rigorous randomized controlled trial study designs, longitudinal follow-up, and critical appraisal of texts to better understand effective interventions on persistent mental health stigma among medical students.',

    title: 'A Pilot Study of Orthopedic Applicants Regarding Sub-internship Number, Cost, and Preferences.',
    abstract: 'Background and objective This pilot study surveyed orthopedic applicants regarding their experience with sub-internship (sub-I) rotations (number, cost, and selection criteria), seeking to identify potential barriers, and their implications for residency selection for future study. Methods Applicants to two orthopedic residencies in the Philadelphia area received surveys regarding the number/cost of sub-Is, factors affecting rotation site selection, and the influence of people/experiences on the rank list. Surveys were available between the rank list certification deadline and the match week. Results One hundred ninety out of 936 (20.3%) applicants completed the survey. One hundred thirty-three (70%) respondents completed ≥4 rotations (inclusive of home rotations). Osteopathic applicants completed more rotations than allopathic applicants (mean {M}=5.1 versus 3.8, p<0.001). Fifty-seven (30.0%) respondents stated that their rotation time was limited by cost, with 116 (61.1%) reporting a monthly cost of >$1600. Factors that were most important to applicants when selecting a rotation site were geographic location (4.8), program reputation (3.9), and word of mouth (3.8), while factors that were less important to applicants included social media presence (1.9), scholarship opportunities (2.1), and program website (2.5). Women valued program diversity more than men (3.6 versus 2.5, p<0.001). Residents (4.8) were the most influential people when determining rank order. Conclusions Current orthopedic applicants may be completing more sub-Is at a greater cost. Larger, nationally representative samples should seek to confirm these findings and determine whether sub-Is represent a barrier to entry in orthopedics. Our findings also highlight applicant preferences when selecting sub-Is and determining rank order. This should help programs better direct recruitment efforts and provide a more applicant-focused rotation experience.',

    title: 'Ultrasound Evaluation of Cosmetic Changes in Nails: A Case Series and Literature Review.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The use of semi-permanent nail polishes and acrylic nails is rising due to cosmetic appeal, but may lead to underrecognized complications. High-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) offers a non-invasive method for assessing nail structural changes beyond clinical examination.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVES: To describe ultrasound findings in patients with complications from semi-permanent polishes and acrylic nails and correlate them with clinical presentations.\n' +
      'METHODS: This descriptive study included 13 women over six months who used semi-permanent polishes or acrylic nails and presented with nail alterations. HFUS was performed using 8-22 MHz probes to assess nail structures in grayscale and Doppler. Defined criteria identified brittle nails, onychomadesis, ventral pterygium, and onychocryptosis. Data were analyzed descriptively.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among 13 patients, 69.2% used semi-permanent polishes and 30.8% used acrylic nails. Brittle nails were most common overall (30.8%), primarily in semi-permanent polish users (44.4%), while ventral pterygium predominated among acrylic nail users (50%). HFUS revealed methacrylate deposits within the intermediate plate in 55.6% of semi-permanent polish users. Increased vascularization on Doppler was seen in all cases, suggesting chronic inflammatory processes. Multiple structural alterations were frequently observed in individual patients.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: HFUS effectively identified structural and vascular complications linked to cosmetic nail procedures, often detecting subclinical changes. Methacrylate incorporation into the nail plate may underlie many findings in semi-permanent polish users, while matrix atrophy and ventral pterygium were more typical of acrylic nails. These results highlight the importance of patient education and dermatologic monitoring. Larger studies are warranted to confirm these associations.',

    title: 'Keeping Lectures Alive in Undergraduate Medical Education: Current Status, Evolution, and Future Goals.',
    abstract: 'Lectures have been the cornerstone of education for centuries. As society has modernized, science has elucidated multiple key aspects required for effective learning and retention of knowledge. In the last several decades, undergraduate medical education (UME) has changed with the incorporation of mandatory active small group learning and self-directed study in pre-clerkship education. Lectures have become non-mandatory school activities with poor attendance by students and a sore subject by the UME community. In addition, the use of standardized national exams throughout medical school has paved the way for the use of third-party commercial resources focused on "high-yield" materials that are widely supported by students and schools. Consequently, medical students have begun to forego traditional didactics in favor of commercial resources and self-study time. Hence, there is a growing frustration among faculty over poor attendance and engagement. However, lectures and seminars have continued to thrive in clerkships, graduate medical education, and continuing medical education despite the downfall in pre-clerkship education. Lectures in pre-clerkship education may need to be restructured and delivered in a style that fits the growing educational needs of advanced adult learners. This article critically reviews the historical role and current status of lecture in UME, while providing recommendations for future actionable changes.',

    title: 'Enhancing emotional intelligence in medical education: a systematic review of interventions.',
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Emotional intelligence (EI) is a crucial competency for medical professionals, facilitating effective interpersonal relationships between physicians and patients. The ability to evaluate, regulate, and apply emotional understanding plays a significant role in fostering empathy, communication, and stress management. This systematic review aimed to determine the impact of various interventions on medical students' EI development, academic performance, and overall patient care.\n" +
      'METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted for studies published from 2021 until 2024, inclusion criteria focused on studies on medical students, employed validated EI assessment tools, and utilized appropriate research designs.\n' +
      "RESULTS: 44 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist was applied to assess the quality of included studies. Although a meta-analysis was initially planned, substantial heterogeneity across the studies limited the pooling of quantitative data. Using an inductive coding approach, eight major themes were identified: Narrative and Storytelling Interventions, Reflective Practices and Writing, Communication Skills Training, Emotional Intelligence Enhancement, Experiential Learning and Patient Exposure, Stress, Burnout, and Coping Interventions, Assessment Tools and Structural Interventions, and Personalized Interventions and Diversity Considerations. These themes were subsequently mapped onto Daniel Goleman's model of Emotional Intelligence to provide a structured theoretical framework.\n" +
      'DISCUSSION: The findings of this review highlight that various interventions hold promise in enhancing EI among medical students, leading to improvements in personal well-being, communication skills, and professional development. The most effective approach appears to be a multifaceted, longitudinal integration of EI-focused strategies throughout medical training, incorporating repeated practice, guided reflection, faculty mentorship, and structured debriefing. The broader implications extend to improved doctor-patient relationships, reduced burnout, and enhanced clinical decision-making, ultimately contributing to higher patient satisfaction and more compassionate healthcare delivery. Future research should focus on refining intervention methodologies and assessing their long-term impact on medical education and practice.',

    title: "Undergraduate nursing students' experiences during international clinical placement: A scoping review.",
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: Immigration, combined with the growth of multicultural societies, has increased patient diversity, highlighting the need for cultural competence in healthcare to prepare nurses to understand the nature of global health. Nurses should have knowledge to understand and respect how culture influences patients' health needs, access to healthcare services, and the health-related decision-making process. Offering international clinical placement to nursing students is one way to increase this cultural competence. No scoping review has mapped undergraduate nursing students' experiences during international clinical placement.\n" +
      "OBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of published studies on undergraduate nursing students' experiences during international clinical placement.\n" +
      'DESIGN: A scoping review.\n' +
      "METHODS: A systematic search was performed in three databases (CINAHL, Medline, PubMed). The inclusion criteria were: 1) studies with quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods design, 2) studies reporting undergraduate nursing students' experiences of international clinical placement and 3) studies published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language between January 2008 and February 2023. Pairs of authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data. Data were thematically grouped.\n" +
      'RESULTS: 42 papers were included, 39 studies employed a qualitive design, while 3 studies employed a quantitative design. All studies included students from Western countries with international clinical placement in non-Western countries. Most students had international clinical placement in hospitals, with a wide range of length of exchange. Four thematic groupings were identified: 1) developing cultural competence through culture shock, 2) a novel way of practicing nursing due to a different nursing role, 3) the essential role of the supervisor in learning outcomes and 4) the impact of language barriers on learning outcomes.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Students developed cultural competence by experiencing culture shock when exposed to an unfamiliar cultural environment. While they often reacted negatively to these differences, they often adjusted their prejudices and biases over time. Language skills were the greatest barrier to achieving learning outcomes, creating more frustration than cultural barriers. There is a need to investigate how non-Western students experience studying in a Western country.',
