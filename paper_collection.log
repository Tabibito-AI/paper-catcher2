    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'Mothers’ duties and rights when positioned as remote education tutors in Australian distance schooling',
    summary: 'Remote education tutors (RETs) conduct the vital but undervalued work of delivering distance schooling to geographically isolated students in Australian rural and remote settings. Part of a broader research project, this paper reports the findings of extended, semi-structured interviews with four women who discharged dual roles as mothers and RETs of their child/ren. Conceptually and methodologically, the study draws on positioning theory to construct dynamic storylines for the participants that explicated how each mother navigated her respective self-reported duties and rights with reference to distance education, as manifested in the particular ways that they positioned themselves and others and in how they were positioned by others. The findings demonstrated both continuities and divergences among the participants’ experiences and perceptions of their duties and rights, as well as diverse strategies and varied self-confidence in their work as RETs, all of which were framed and enacted in the specific contexts of their separate home-based schoolrooms. These findings affirm the crucial value of the mother RETs in facilitating their child/ren’s successful learning outcomes, and also underscore the importance of financial compensation if their work is to be equitable and sustainable in the long term.',

    title: '‘Quality and consequence’: interrogating the drive for new performance indicators and funding levers in Australian initial teacher education programs',
    summary: 'Performance indicators and other accountability measures are increasingly common in higher education internationally. Consistent with this trend, the Australian Federal Government’s Teacher Education Expert Panel (TEEP) recently recommended new reforms to strengthen the link between performance and funding of initial teacher education (ITE). Recommended reforms included (i) the measurement and publication of ITE performance on four categories of indicators, including student selection, student retention, graduate readiness, and the employment outcomes of recent graduates and early career teachers, and (ii) the use of transition, excellence, or compact-based funding as levers for driving quality. While the proposal for the adoption of performance indicators to measure the quality of ITE has since been accepted by Australian Education ministers, our inductive content analysis of 56 public submissions in response to the proposed reforms revealed a divergence of views on the validity of the proposed performance measures and the potential impacts of these indicators on student diversity and graduation numbers. Higher education providers, Deans of Education, employers, teachers’ associations, and teacher regulatory authorities were consistent in arguing that the proposed indicators were not direct measures of quality and may have perverse or unintended consequences, with providers incentivised to ‘game the system’. Some stakeholders also queried assumptions that current accreditation processes are not sufficient to drive quality. We discuss implications of this reform for implementation and policy, noting important anomalies between stakeholder feedback and recommendations made in the final TEEP report.',

    title: 'What makes quality teachers in remote First Nations schools and what difference do they make?',
    summary: 'Over recent years there has been a strong emphasis on engagement and attendance as indicators of success in remote First Nations education. Attendance in remote schools has been steadily falling for several years. At the same time teacher quality and quality teaching have been described as critical for student outcomes. Finding teachers who have the right qualities and experience for working in remote schools has long been a challenge. In this article, we ask the question: What is quality teaching in remote First Nations schools, and what difference does it make? The article is based on research conducted in Western Australia and the Northern Territory during 2023 by researchers from Batchelor Institute, Curtin University and University of Notre Dame. The research involved a quantitative survey involving 226 respondents, and qualitative interviews or yarns with 139 respondents, mostly conducted by Aboriginal community-based researchers. The sample included students, teachers and school staff, principals, and community members. The research aimed to determine why young people engaged with school, and what schools are doing to support young people to complete Year 12. Some of the strongest responses in the qualitative data suggested that the quality of teachers (not so much about the quality of teaching) affects student engagement. There were also indications in the quantitative data that teachers are important for engagement. Local teachers, and teachers who brought cultural knowledge, and who were able to support first language learning were recognised as making a positive impact.',

    title: 'Public management of digitalization into the Spanish tourism services: a heterodox analysis',
    summary: "This study is a critical review of public intervention and its management of change with digitalization, applied to Spanish tourism services, as ones of the largest case and most required of attention into the European Union. In comparison with other mainstream papers, this heterodox review is based on the combination of Austrian Economics and Neo-Institutional approaches ( Cornucopists ), with their common theoretical and methodological frameworks. Thus, it is possible to analyze failures and paradoxes in the public intervention, especially with post-COVID recovery policies. The case of the Spanish tourism sector highlights the effect of double bureaucracy, from European institutions and the Spanish Government, affecting its competitiveness and revealing the confirmation of heterodox theorems. Faced with mainstream public intervention guidelines, which usually involve expansive spending and more debt (and New-Malthusian measures), a heterodox mainline solution is offered here, based on the revival of the original sustainability principle, the readjustment effect and the promotion of geek'n'talent education, to facilitate the transition to the Knowledge Economy, where the tourism sector is capable of offering personalized travel experiences due to digitalization.",

    title: 'In pursuit of equity in upper secondary education: the curious case of Ghana’s free senior high school policy',
    summary: 'The Free Senior High School policy is Ghana’s attempt at actualising the SDG 4 global consensus on free upper secondary education. Using grounded theory method, this research scrutinises the Free SHS 2018 policy and strategy document, alongside interviews with policymakers, to answer the question: How does the equity provision ensure fairness in upper secondary education, and what equity blind spots exist? Specifically, the study employed a purposive sampling technique, allowing for the deliberate selection of data sources that ensured the collection of focused, meaningful data aligned with the research goals. The findings underscore a disconnect between the policy’s equity intentions and solutions. For example, the policy highlights that, intersectional differences—such as economic, school-based, gender, and regional factors—persist and drive inequitable access. However, these issues are inadequately addressed because the policy applies cookie-cutter-style economic solutions to all inequity concerns. Policymakers from within, and outside from government, hold diverse perspectives on the impact of this disconnect on sub-populations. The former underscores political and technical accountabilities where increasing numbers of enrolment are equated to equity, while the latter underscores differential policy effect sizes on sub-population to mean inequity. Curiously, the policy has improved access despite the equity conundrum, weak economy, lack of private–public initiatives, declining GDP allocation to education, no selective fee waivers, and neglect of secondary education expansion prerequisites. The paper advocates realigning the policy’s equity dimension with its equity goals.',

    title: 'A phenomenological reading of integration in the longitudinal integrated clerkship',
    summary: 'This paper reports on a phenomenological reading of integration in education programs, through three layers of specificity: (1) broadly, on integration as an educational idea; (2) more particularly, on integration as expressed in the program model of the longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC); and (3) with the highest degree of specificity, on integration ‘at work’ in an actual LIC program. Each layer of penetration found different aspects of the phenomenological nature of integration. A further integrative leap across these aspects phenomenologically revealed four essential qualities of integration, being: integration transforms parts into wholes; integration’s animating locus is mutable, mobile and multiple; integration is already at work and is sustained through possibility; and integration holds open for ‘more’ integration. By appreciating integration for its essential qualities, this research adds foundational value to the literature on educational integration, and opens new questions about how we, as educators, might deliberately work with both its presence and its promise in our educational pedagogies, practices and programs.',

    title: 'The positioning of quality and expertise in initial teacher education: policy enactment in the Australian context',
    summary: 'Teacher quality and teacher education improvement have been central discourses for at least two decades in global education. In Australia, despite the pervasive nature of these discussions, there is a lack of substantial evidence indicating the existence of a problem in this regard. Policies aimed at enhancing the ‘preparedness’ of teacher graduates and elevating the ‘quality’ of ITE programs have nonetheless emerged as prevalent solutions over the past decade. The latest enactment of reforms in the policy chain is the Strong Beginnings report from the Teacher Education Expert Panel. In this paper, we align with Ball’s perspective that policy should be viewed as a dynamic process rather than a presumed, ready-made solution to a problem. We utilise systematic conceptual coding using Leximancer to enable a nuanced exploration of the understandings, practices, and conditions of influence for the policy actors inscribed in the TEEP report. We also analyse concept frequency and collocation in the final Strong Beginnings report, noting two main propositions: first, that there is a problem with quality in ITE; and second, that practice is foregrounded in professionalisation. We highlight the consistencies and contradictions within the discourses of the final report and the submissions from policy actors that contributed to this policy enactment process. We suggest that evidence is used when it suits a policy position, but ignored if it disrupts the platform position. We conclude by arguing that the policy actors in this policy enactment process should be afforded the professional authority to continue a well-established process of continual improvement.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    summary: 'In this paper, we suggest that poetic inquiry offers a pathway for capturing the deeply felt, personal dimensions of ongoing identity growth of initial teacher educators of professional experience. We propose that poetic inquiry provides an avenue for authentically sharing experiences and insights into caring and being cared for, diverging from conventional academic narratives. Through poetic self-reflection and collective poetic representation, we can uncover and navigate the subtle tensions shaping our identity journey, fostering a communal understanding of the teacher educator’s role within the contexts of Australian higher education and initial teacher education.',

    title: 'Digital redesign of the radiotherapy course for medical students with a blended learning approach',
    summary: 'Purpose Due to the need for high-quality teaching, we present a new blended learning concept combining digital modules, interactive seminars, and clinical experience. Furthermore, we evaluated its acceptance among students. Methods A new concept for teaching was applied to the radiotherapy module and made available via the Hannover Medical School (MHH) learning management system as part of a blended learning concept with educational films, multimedia learning modules, online seminars, and onsite practical training. The evaluation recorded assessments of the requirement profile, design, and opportunities for skills acquisition; evaluation of the seminar and internship; and questions on the overall assessment. Results The new concept was applied to four passes in the fourth academic year. A total of 152 students completed the radio-oncology learning module, which was evaluated by 46 students. Forty students considered the course duration to be appropriate for the material covered, and most students stated that their prior knowledge had been sufficient. The level of difficulty of the content was rated by the students as somewhat too high. The design of the digital course, the opportunity to acquire skills, the seminar course, and the practical course were mostly rated positively. Conclusion Through digital redesign, a teaching concept can be implemented that combines self-determined learning, professional exchange with doctors, and clinical practice experience. The concept can be transferred to other areas because it combines theoretical knowledge transfer with synchronous teaching and clinical experience. The results of the evaluation show that the students rated the new concept well.',

    title: 'Who receives health advice? Prevalence and correlates of receiving health advice among adults in Cape Verde.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Achieving the sustainable development goal target 3.4 requires an all-hand-on-deck approach. Healthcare professionals are expected to provide health advice on lifestyle changes that will reduce the risk of developing non-communicable diseases, or improve the quality of life of those who already have the condition. The study examined the prevalence and correlates of receiving health advice among adults in Cape Verde.\n' +
      'METHODS: We analyzed the data 1,098 adults aged 18-69 years who participated in the 2020 WHO STEPS survey. All estimates were weighted. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were performed to assess correlates of receiving at least one health advice. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05, with 95% confidence intervals reported.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Overall, 60.4% (95%CI: 55.3, 62.3) of adults in Cape Verde had received at least one health advice. Compared to younger adults (< 30 years), individuals aged 30-59 years having 1.55 times higher odds (AOR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.11-2.15) and those aged 60 years and older having nearly three times the odds (AOR = 2.93, 95%CI: 1.71-5.02) of receiving advice. Previously married (AOR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.09-2.61) and cohabiting individuals had higher odds (AOR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.12-2.18) of receiving advice compared to those who were never married. Alcohol consumption was inversely associated with receiving advice, as drinkers had 40% lower odds of receiving advice compared to non-drinkers (AOR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.45-0.81). Individuals consuming fewer than four servings of fruit per day had significantly lower odds of receiving advice (AOR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.37-0.90), while those consuming fewer than four servings of vegetables per day had 1.41 times higher odds (AOR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.06-1.88). The likelihood of receiving health advice was high among those living with hypertension (AOR = 1.94, 95%CI: 1.41-2.65).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Evidence from this study suggests that there is a moderately high prevalence of receiving health advice in Cape Verde. The key correlates are hypertension status, increasing age, marital status, alcohol consumption and dietary habits. The findings underscore the need for targeted health education and counseling strategies that address the unique needs of different population subgroups, particularly younger adults, non-drinkers, and those with suboptimal dietary habits, to ensure equitable access to health advice.',

    title: 'Exclusive breastfeeding practices in Afghanistan: evidence from the 2022-2023 multiple indicator cluster survey.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: National prevalence estimates of exclusive breastfeeding practices could serve as the basis for future policy efforts and specific interventions. However, little is known about the prevalence and factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding practices in Afghanistan. This study aims to determine the prevalence and factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding practices among infants aged 0-5 months in Afghanistan.\n' +
      'METHODS: Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) data collected between 2022 and 2023 were used for this analysis. Data from 3,141 mother-infant dyads were included in the study. The outcome variable was exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), defined as the proportion of infants 0-5 months of age who were fed only breast milk in the past 24 h. Binary logistic regression models were applied to examine the likelihood of EBF across the categories of independent variables.\n' +
      'RESULTS: In the studied population, 67.0% (95%CI 65%-69%) of the infants were exclusively breastfed. The likelihood of EBF was higher in infants born to mothers with secondary or higher education [AOR = 1.35, 95%CI 1.04-1.76] and in infants with timely initiation of breastfeeding [AOR = 1.25, 95%CI 1.07-1.46]. However, the female sex of the infant was associated with lower odds of EBF practices [AOR = 0.83, 95%CI 0.72-0.97].\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: The practice of exclusive breastfeeding is at a good level (67%) in Afghanistan. Higher maternal education level, timely breastfeeding initiation, and being a male infant increased the likelihood of EBF practices. Policy efforts and interventions focused on these factors could enhance EBF practices in Afghanistan.',

    title: 'The nexus between healthcare provider distribution and neonatal mortality based on the context of maternal and child healthcare services in Pakistan.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Healthcare provider dearth, particularly in Low and Middle-income countries (LMICs), reduces the development towards improved healthcare outcomes and accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs-3). This study aims to investigate the association between Professional and Non-professional healthcare provider distribution and neonatal mortality through the mediating role of maternal and child healthcare (MCH) services in Pakistan.\n' +
      'METHODS: The present research used data from the 2018 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) total sample that comprises (N = 8022). The dependent variable includes the risk of neonatal mortality 0-30 days. Bivariate and Multivariate analyses were conducted by utilizing the Cox proportional hazards and regression models. The estimation of mortality rates was achieved through generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM) and the 5000 bootstrap technique. All the investigations were carried out in STATA v. 16.1.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Our results revealed that around 2.46% of neonatal deaths occur. The average healthcare provider distribution type was professional, 83.45%, non-professional, 1.45%, and no care, 15.11%. 0.88% of females are less likely to die within the first thirty days of their birth compared to males. The regression outcomes demonstrate that the healthcare providers were positive and significantly linked to neonatal mortality. Additionally, a unit increase in healthcare providers has a 1.20% Higher likelihood of increasing the MCH and overall reducing neonatal mortality (HR = 0.60).\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: The outcomes illustrate that healthcare provider distribution and MCH play a vital role in minimizing neonatal mortality. To ensure well-distributed healthcare provider distribution, promoting maternal education, empowering women's decision-making in acquiring MCH services utilization, and expanding access to free MCH services are the essentials for better maternal and healthcare outcomes.",

    title: 'Inclusion of under-served groups in trials: an audit at a UK primary care clinical trials unit.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Clinical trials need to include patients who are representative of the population who may receive the tested interventions in the future. The importance of inclusivity is recognised by ethical and funding bodies and has public support. Appropriate inclusion is required to provide equitable evidence-based healthcare and to comply with ethical principles for research. However, there is little information about the inclusivity of most under-served groups in UK clinical trials.\n' +
      'METHODS: This audit assesses the inclusion of under-served groups in trials run by the Oxford Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit (PC-CTU). We included trials with ethical approval between 2017 and 2023. We checked protocols, patient-facing information and selected data collection tools for information on the under-served groups in the INCLUDE guidance and protected characteristics in the UK Equality Act 2010, to identify explicit exclusions and data collection.\n' +
      'RESULTS: We included 19 trials. They were in a variety of clinical conditions, testing different types of interventions, both Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP) and non-CTIMP. Most were non-commercially funded. We reviewed 21 protocols, 29 Patient Information Sheets/Leaflets and 40 data collection tools. Common exclusions were based on age (19), sex or gender (11), language (8), capacity to consent (14), pregnancy (11), multiple health conditions (10) and severity of illness (17). Trials most often collected data on age (19), sex or gender (15), ethnicity (16), education (11), address (13), mental health conditions (6), who gave consent (19), addiction (6), multiple health conditions (10), severity of illness (17), smoking status (12) and obesity (13).\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: Often, exclusions were due to the focusing of the trial for a specific group, such as older people, women, or people being treated for a specific severity of condition. However, many explicit exclusions may not have been essential, may have reduced the inclusivity of the trials and might limit the applicability of the trial's findings to people to whom the tested interventions might be relevant. These include the exclusion of people aged under 18, people without English language fluency and people without capacity to consent. All trials could have collected more informative data on under-served group status.",

    title: 'The effect of promotional health message framing on the perceived benefit of mammography: evidence from estimation of willingness to pay.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Evidence from behavioral economics has shown that framing health information can impact the demand for screening. We examined the effect of promotional message framing on mammography demand by estimating willingness to pay (WTP).\n' +
      'METHODS: This experimental study was conducted in 2024 over a period of 3 months. The interesting outcome was a WTP for mammography. 354 women were randomly selected and randomly assigned between the two study arms. The intervention involved the presentation of health information in two frames of gain and loss. The mammography demand has been estimated using robust standard error Logistic regression. Demand rate of mammography has been compared between two types of information framing using the chi-square test. Finally, the monetary value of willingness to pay (WTP) for mammography was estimated using the methodology developed by López-Feldman. All analyses were done using STATA 17.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The price and income elasticity of mammography demand were estimated as - 0.19 and 0.24, respectively (P < 0.01). The higher demand rate in the loss frame compared to the gain frame (38.7% vs. 25.1%) was statistically significant, and its effect size was estimated to be 0.282 (p < 0.01). The value of WTP in the loss frame (10.68 US$) was estimated to be more significant than in the gain frame (4.74 US$) (p < 0.01).\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: This study suggests that health educators consider the message's persuasiveness with the type of health action before designing health messages. Moreover, health practitioners should use health messages with a loss frame to increase the demand for screening services such as mammography.",

    title: 'Trends in education-economy-related inequalities in the prevalence of early childhood untreated caries in Guangdong, China from 2005 to 2021.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Early childhood untreated caries (ECC) has numerous adverse effects on children and remains more prevalent in Asia than the global average. Despite recent improvements in ECC prediction and treatment, inequalities related to parental education and economic status may persist and have potentially worsened in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study analyzed the trends and associated factors of education- and economy- related inequalities in ECC among 5-year-old children in Guangdong, China, from 2005 to 2021.\n' +
      'METHODS: Data from three cross-sectional surveys from Guangdong, China, were utilized, including dental examinations of 2,584 five-year-old children and parental questionnaires. Logistic regression models and education-economy-related interactions were used to identify factors associated with ECC. The Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII), derived from linear regression models, were applied to access trends in inequalities over the survey years.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Children living in rural areas (OR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.47 to 2.64) and those who have dental visits because of treatment (OR = 5.73, 95%CI = 2.73 to 12.05) were associated with a higher chance of having ECC, compared to their urban and non-visiting counterparts. Children whose parents had high (OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.31 to 0.88) or medium (OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.41 to 0.99) educational levels and those had high (OR = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.43 to 0.85) and medium (OR = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.42 to 0.84) economic levels were associated with a lower chance of having ECC compared those with levels. The highest education- and economy- related SII were observed in 2005. These declined by 14.0 and 4.3% points, respectively, in 2015, but increased again by 9.8 and 0.4% points in 2021. Besides, inequality as measured by SII increased continuously in rural areas. The RII values reflected similar trends in inequality distribution.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: Children from rural areas, lower parental education and family economic level exhibited significantly higher ECC prevalence. The education- and economy- related inequalities persisted across different groups and demonstrated a downward trend overall, but inequalities have continued to rise in rural regions from 2005 to 2021.',

    title: 'Patient-reported quality of outpatient healthcare in patients with chronic back or arthrosis pain with long-term opioid therapy in Germany.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Managing patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) in outpatient healthcare is challenging. Long-term opioid therapy is an option for treatment responders with guideline recommended indications. However, opioid use poses risks of severe side effects, including misuse, and therefore needs to be integrated into a high-quality healthcare process. This analysis evaluates the association between healthcare quality according to the evidence-based Chronic Care Model (CCM) in the treatment process of patients receiving long-term opioid therapy for chronic back and/or arthrosis pain, and patient-related or healthcare related variables.\n' +
      "METHODS: A cross-sectional patient survey was sent to a random sample of 3,037 individuals with long-term opioid therapy and chronic back and/or arthrosis pain insured by a large nationwide German statutory health insurance. Healthcare quality according to the CCM was assessed by the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC-5A) questionnaire. Internal reliability of the assessment instrument was determined using Cronbach's α. Descriptive analysis of the outcome scales were conducted, alongside subgroup analyses considering patient characteristics, patient's health situation, and pain treatment aspects. Testing for statistical significance was performed by Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test. Effect sizes, namely Eta and Spearman's Rank correlation coefficient, were calculated.\n" +
      "RESULTS: The analysis included 661 individuals. Participants were predominantly female (76%) with an average age of 69 years (SD 12.5). PACIC-5A score ratings across all (sub)scales were low, with a summary score rating of 2.4 (on a scale ranging from 1 (worst) to 5 (best)). Positive correlations with treatment quality were observed in the subgroup analysis concerning guideline-compliant pain treatment aspects such as setting therapy goals or a comprehensive treatment concept. Patient characteristics showed little to no correlations, except for a positive correlation between higher PACIC-5A rating and both lower age and higher education. Patient's health situation presented a mixed picture, with no clear correlation between pain intensity/impairment, and PACIC-5A scores.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The provision of healthcare for patients with long-term opioid therapy for CNCP seems to be inadequate according to the CCM. Guideline-recommended pain treatment aspects exhibited a positive correlation with healthcare quality according to CCM. Enhancing the implementation of the CCM in the outpatient healthcare process may improve healthcare quality.\n' +

    title: 'Palliative Care Education in Pediatric Cardiology Fellowships: A Survey of Program Directors.',
    abstract: `With advances in treatment options for severe congenital heart disease, there is a growing population of children and adults living with advanced heart disease, many of whom experience significant long-term comorbidities and uncertain disease trajectories. Although palliative care (PC) plays an integral role in the care of children with advanced heart disease, there is a lack of PC education in pediatric cardiology fellowship training. We distributed a cross-sectional survey to pediatric cardiology fellowship program directors (PDs) nationally (n = 58). Survey response rate was 48.3% (28/58). PDs reported PC didactic education in 71.4% (20/28) of programs, with 95% (19/20) reporting this education came from PC specialists, 35% (7/20) from pediatric cardiologists, 25% (5/20) from cardiac intensivists, and 10% (2/20) from general pediatric intensivists. Simulation was used by 10.7% (3/28) of programs. Only one program utilized online modules. Informal bedside teaching occurred in 92.9% (26/28) of programs, and dedicated PC rotations in 25% (7/28). Most programs endorsed annual formal didactics on various PC topics, although some topics were covered more frequently and some never covered by individual programs. Only 53.8% (14/26) of PDs were satisfied with the amount of PC education while 76.9% (20/26) were satisfied with the quality of PC education. Barriers included "too much other content to cover" (77%) and "lack of faculty expertise" (27%). A subset of PDs rated graduating fellows' skills as less than competent in advance care planning (38.5%), criticall illness communication (15.4%), and complex symptom management (15.4%). With a wide range of PC education practices and high rate of PD dissatisfaction with PC education in their programs, there is a need for standardized PC training recommendations and curriculum.`,

    title: 'Dermatologic Adverse Event Mitigation and Management Strategies with Amivantamab + Lazertinib Therapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Vodcast.',
    abstract: 'Targeted therapies have transformed outcomes of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Amivantamab, a bispecific antibody targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MET, and lazertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, were approved in 2024 for the first-line treatment of EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletion/exon 21 L858R substitution) locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. While EGFR-targeted therapies have demonstrated clinical efficacy, they are associated with on-target dermatologic adverse events (AEs). This vodcast aims to educate on strategies to mitigate and manage dermatologic AEs associated with amivantamab + lazertinib. The MARIPOSA study assessed amivantamab + lazertinib versus osimertinib in previously untreated patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. In the same population, the COCOON study assessed the impact of enhanced versus standard dermatologic management on the incidence of grade ≥ 2 dermatologic AEs. In MARIPOSA, amivantamab + lazertinib significantly improved overall survival (median not reached vs 36.7 months) and progression-free survival (median 23.7 vs 16.6 months) versus osimertinib. The most common EGFR-associated dermatologic AEs were rash and paronychia. To address these AEs, the COCOON study evaluated enhanced dermatologic management strategies (including prophylactic oral and topical antibiotics and moisturizer) versus standard of care dermatologic management, which resulted in a two-fold reduction in grade ≥ 2 dermatologic AEs with COCOON versus standard dermatologic management. We further discuss the COCOON prophylactic regimen together with reactive and expert-recommended dermatologic management approaches. In conclusion, amivantamab + lazertinib is an effective treatment that significantly improves overall survival. While dermatologic AEs are common, effective proactive management strategies, as demonstrated in the COCOON study, can help reduce the incidence and severity of dermatologic AEs. Prioritizing education for healthcare providers and patients will facilitate timely identification and proactive and reactive management of these events, ultimately improving the treatment experience for patients undergoing therapy with amivantamab and lazertinib.',

    title: "Diving practices in technical divers' community and behaviour towards self-reported unusual symptoms.",
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: The use of gas mixtures containing helium for deep recreational diving is increasingly common, involving complex logistics and decision-making compromises. The characteristics and inherent risks of this practice remain poorly documented. This study aims to provide an epidemiological inventory of practices and diving-related incidents within the technical diving community.\n' +
      'METHODS: An international online survey was disseminated on social networks targeting certified trimix divers. It collected demographic data, diving experience, and dive management practices, along with self-reported unusual symptoms, treatments, and outcomes following trimix dives.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 558 questionnaires were analysed, predominantly from males (92%), mostly over 46 years old (61%), with high certification levels and recreational diving purposes. Forty-two percent reported one or more medical risk factors related to diving. Rebreather use was prevalent (79% at least occasionally). Decompression was primarily managed using compartmental models (85%) with gradient-factors adjustment. Dive planning varied significantly among individuals. Gas density at depth frequently exceeded the current recommendations. Ten percent had experienced symptoms suggestive of gas toxicity, mainly related to nitrogen narcosis. Thirty-six percent (199/558) reported experiencing, at least once, symptoms of diving-related incidents, with 61% (n = 121/199) expressing certainty. In 48% (120/261) of incidents involving decompression sickness (DCS) or breathing symptoms, no treatment was initiated. Among episodes involving DCS symptoms (n = 254), 42% received normobaric oxygen, and 23% sought medical advice, while 16% were treated with hyperbaric oxygen. Only 2.5% reported probable long-lasting sequelae.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The diversity of practices highlights the lack of robust scientific data supporting them. The accident rate in mixed-gas diving may be higher than in typical scuba air diving, though mostly of mild severity. Treatment appears to be neglected despite divers' high knowledge levels.
