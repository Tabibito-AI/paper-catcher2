    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    summary: "In today's era of knowledge innovation, STEM workers are the source of motivation for economic progress in many economies, and model-based STEM technical and vocational education is more conducive to establishing students’ entrepreneurial scientific thinking abilities. As a result, this study focuses on 169 students’ assessments and interviews on their entrepreneurial scientific thinking skills following the educational technology experience learning activity. The research results show the following four points: (1) The developed entrepreneurial scientific thinking ability questionnaire has high reliability; (2) This questionnaire is feasible in model-based STEM education; (3) After STEM experiential learning of the entrepreneurial scientific thinking, 47% of students showed high-efficiency entrepreneurial scientific thinking ability; (4) Through thematic interviews, we can better understand the difficulties students face during the experience process, and can use learning experience and interaction to solve technical problems. In the future, STEM learning will enrich the overall ability of entrepreneurial scientific thinking to improve from action, doing and understanding.",

    title: 'Optimization of Corporate Governance from the Perspectives of Law and Economics and Blockchain',
    summary: 'Blockchain’s spontaneous consensus mechanism, characterized by technologies of decentralization, immutability, high transparency, and codification, helps address agency costs and the formalization of shareholder meetings in traditional corporate governance. With the advancement of blockchain technology, the integration of legal rules and code rules in corporate governance has become the new norm. As per the transaction cost theory of law and economics and the Coase Theorem, blockchain has promoted changes in governance rules by markedly reducing agency costs within companies. Corporate governance will exhibit partial and gradual adjustments when blockchain technology substantially diminishes these costs but falls short of achieving the optimal state of zero transaction costs. These changes not only enhance the transparency and efficiency of corporate governance but also effectively curb the misconduct of controlling shareholders and protect the rights of minority shareholders.',

    summary: 'Although Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) presents vast opportunities and potential within the educational domain, the optimal integration of educational theory with GAI to enhance academic performance and problem-solving skills remains an area that requires further exploration. Therefore, this study aims to develop an integrating GAI with self-explanations scaffolding platform to enhance students’ learning performance and problem-solving skills through completing scaffolding tasks. Furthermore, this study evaluates students’ perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the system based on the Technology Acceptance Model. The findings indicate that students in the experimental group demonstrated a significant improvement in learning performance and problem-solving skills after utilizing the platform proposed by this study. Additionally, the experimental group exhibited positive technology acceptance toward the platform. Finally, results from the semi-structured interviews suggest that learning programming through the self-explanations scaffolding platform can mitigate learning setbacks, provide cognitive guidance, strengthen conceptual connections, facilitate knowledge construction, and enhance application skills.',

Based on the 6E+R learning model, an AI-supported summative reflection tool was implemented in a collaborative problem-solving (CPS) activity to examine its effects on students’ learning motivation, teamwork competency, and reflective content. A total of 28 high school students participated in a one-day Micro:bit autonomous vehicle workshop and were randomly assigned to either an experimental or control group.

Topic modeling using BERTopic revealed that the experimental group's reflections focused more on strategy adjustment, logical reasoning, and conceptual understanding, whereas the control group's reflections were more descriptive and operational. These findings suggest that AI-supported structured feedback can enhance the quality of student reflections, increase learning engagement, and improve collaborative interactions. This study demonstrates the practical value and effectiveness of AI-assisted reflection within the 6E+R instructional model, offering new directions for reflective design in STEM collaborative learning and expanding the potential of generative AI in educational settings.",

    title: 'Non-Immersive Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) with XR Elements in Nursing Education: Learning Interaction and Clinical Competence',
    summary: 'The way nursing students acquire clinical competence and patient safety awareness has changed as a result of the adoption of virtual learning environments (VLEs) in healthcare education. Non-immersive VLEs that display virtual scenarios offer secure learning experiences. Easily accessible and reasonably priced non-immersive VLEs can safely enhance learning clinical procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no earlier research on non-immersive VLEs with extended reality (XR) elements in nursing education, and this research fills that gap. This study investigates nursing students’ expectations and experiences of using non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to learn interaction and clinical competence, such as infusion pump operations. It also explores the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the use of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements in this context. Fifteen first-year nursing students engaged in two non-immersive learning scenarios. The learning process was structured using a seven-phase simulation pedagogy. The data were collected using pre- and post-questionnaires; group discussions; and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings highlight the potential of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to enhance engagement, confidence, and competence acquisition in nursing students while complementing traditional hands-on training. The study highlights the importance of blended learning strategies that integrate technical and scenario-based approaches, as well as simulation pedagogy, to optimize knowledge retention and clinical competency development. As digital technologies continue to shape healthcare education, non-immersive VLEs with XR elements are valuable in bridging the gap between theory and practice, ultimately contributing to patient safety and improved healthcare outcomes.',

    title: 'Conversion Process in the Production and Distribution of Digital Resources in Higher Education',
    summary: 'Academics worldwide are the main creators of digital resources for various purposes in educational settings. These digital resources can be created, stored, shared, and accessed across multiple digital platforms. Generally, these resources fall into categories such as online resources, electronic resources, research publications, open educational resources, and open-source materials, among others. While all academics are encouraged to contribute to the production and distribution of these digital resources, challenges remain. It is unclear whether all academics are able or willing to contribute. Currently, there is a lack of a clear conversion process framework to guide academics to convince others to adopt digital resources. This study aims to explore how those who do contribute can persuade others to participate or take the initiative. To address this issue, the study proposed the conversion process as its conceptual framework. An interpretivist approach was adopted, employing qualitative methods as the primary research strategy, which included 54 semi-structured interviews conducted at the University of South Africa. The findings indicate that both academics and institutional social capital play crucial roles in the conversion process, as they influence others to utilize digital resources. Additionally, this study contributes by proposing a conceptual framework for the conversion process and recommends further testing of this framework within the technology development contexts.',

    title: 'A Virtual Reality-Based Co-creation Approach to Developing Narrative Competence and Empathy in EFL Nursing Education',
    summary: 'This study investigates the use of virtual reality (VR) as a pedagogical tool to foster English narrative competence and empathy among nursing students in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. Through a 16-week course-integrated intervention, 98 third-year nursing students in a five-year associate degree program at a junior nursing college participated in a co-creation project using CoSpaces Edu to collaboratively design immersive, first-person 3D narratives based on an end-of-life care scenario. The project aimed to develop students’ linguistic skills while promoting humanistic understanding through perspective-taking. Employing a mixed-methods design, the study incorporated pre- and post-intervention vocabulary tests, oral narrative evaluations, student reflections, and interviews. Results demonstrated significant gains in English vocabulary and narrative expression, increased oral confidence, and evidence of enhanced empathy as students adopted diverse character roles in their digital stories. The findings underscore the pedagogical affordances of VR-based co-creation in EFL instruction for healthcare students, revealing how immersive storytelling can bridge language learning with humanistic nursing education. Implications for XR-enhanced language education and interdisciplinary curriculum design are discussed.',

    title: 'Using Social Network Analysis to Analyze Eye-Tracking Behavior Data in Education Science',
    summary: 'This study aims to systematically evaluate the use of social network analysis (SNA) metrics to measure eye-tracking behavior to assess and predict student learning performance. We integrated 11 network metrics from published research and tested them on six eye-tracking datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that no consistent predictor variable can effectively predict student performance across different datasets. The number of nodes, edges, reciprocity, and entropy measures contribute differently to predicting students’ performance. This work deepens our understanding of how different SNA metrics relate to eye-tracking data and advances the methodological framework to predict learning outcomes.',

    title: 'Women with endometriosis: Experiences with pain management and views on optimal healthcare through the concept of health literacy.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, characterised by pain and potential fertility reduction, affecting 6%-10% of women. Pain management courses may promote self-care and enhance patient satisfaction. However, research into the experiences of participation in such courses are lacking.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVES: The study aims to describe the experiences of Norwegian women with endometriosis after pain management course and their view on optimal healthcare through organisational and individual health literacy.\n' +
      'DESIGN: Qualitative study as part of a randomised controlled trial (NCT05091268).\n' +
      'METHODS: Semi-structured individual in-depth interviews were conducted between August and November 2023 with 19 women diagnosed with endometriosis, recruited from two University hospitals specialising in endometriosis care, through a patient organisation and social media, after participation in a multidisciplinary pain management course.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Reflexive thematic analysis yielded two main themes: (1) Insightful experiences with individual health literacy and (2) frustrating experiences with organisational health literacy. Participants reported a positive shift in their ability to self-manage endometriosis following the pain management course, demonstrating a progression from passive to active participation in their own care. The participants also expressed a strong and recurring need for enhanced dissemination of information, including a need for post-diagnosis educational courses, highlighting a demand for ongoing, interactive support tailored to their condition.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: A need emerges for improved dissemination of information, enhanced monitoring, and health expertise at an organisational level within the healthcare system. Thus, future health care services should aim to provide seamless, multidisciplinary treatment to improve patient satisfaction.\n' +

    title: "Global and regional white matter hyperintensities in Alzheimer's disease: Exploring etiologies and cognitive correlates.",
    abstract: "BackgroundWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH) are commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their underlying pathophysiology remains poorly understood.ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study aims to explore the multifactorial etiologies and cognitive correlates of global and regional WMH in a cohort of biologically diagnosed AD patients.MethodsWe included 170 AD patients who underwent brain MRI, neuropsychological testing, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker evaluation within three months. Linear and logostic regressions were used to assess associations between global/regional WMH and age, cerebral microbleeds (CMB), AD biomarkers, cortical atrophy, and vascular risk scores. Sensitivity analyses included replacing vascular score with hypertension, p-tau181 with t-tau, and inclusion of  ε4 status. Associations between Mini-Mental State Exam scores and WMH and atrophy burden were also evaluated, adjusting for age, sex, and education.ResultsGreater global WMH burden was significantly associated with older age (β = 0.03, p < 0.001), lower CSF Aβ levels (β = -0.0014, p = 0.01), and more severe CMB grade (β = 0.48, p = 0.003), but not with vascular risk scores. Regionally, WMH in the paraventricular, frontal, and parietal lobes were linked to CSF Aβ and CMB. Cognitive impairment was independently associated with increased paraventricular WMH burden (β = -0.22, p < 0.001) and medial temporal atrophy (β = -0.82, p < 0.001).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that WMH in AD-particularly in the paraventricular, frontal, and parietal areas-are driven more by AD-specific pathology, including amyloid deposition and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, than by conventional vascular risk. Paraventricular WMH contribute to cognitive decline independent of cortical atrophy, underscoring their relevance as potential imaging biomarkers in AD.",

    title: 'The factors related to the prevention of fall injuries among students in primary schools using the PRECEDE model.',
    abstract: "Falls are considered one of the important causes of injuries and fatalities among children and adolescents. Students are continuously exposed to the risks of falls, in the school environment. Therefore, a thorough examination of student behaviours and the environmental conditions of schools is of significant importance for preventing fall-related injuries in students. This study aims to investigate the influential factors for preventing fall-related injuries among primary school students using the PRECEDE model. This cross-sectional study has been done among 428 primary school students from grades one to six in schools of Hamadan city, located in western Iran. The students were selected randomly through a multi-stage cluster sampling method and data collection has been done between December 2023 and February 2024. The data collection tool was a researcher-made questionnaire based on the PRECEDE model. The questionnaire was included three sections including demographic questions, questions related to the constructs of the PRECEDE model (preventive behaviour constructs; predisposing factors including knowledge and attitude; reinforcing factors; enabling factors; and environmental factors), and questions concerning the history of fall-related injuries at school. The data collection has been done through interviews with the students. Data were analyzed using SPSS24 software after collection. The results of this study revealed that out of 428 students, 131(30.6%) experienced falls, with ages ranging from 7 to 12 years and an average age of 9.5 ± 1.70 years. Among these, 54 (41.2%) were females and 77 (58.7%) were males. The findings indicate that males experienced more falls than females, and females exhibited better preventive behaviours than males ( = 0.002). Most falls occurred in the schoolyard (37.4%) and during recess time (40.5%). The most common types of injuries were abrasions (28.2%) and head injuries (24.4%). Additionally, the findings showed that parents' education level was significantly associated with preventive fall behaviours among students. Hence, the students with parents who had higher education levels (mothers' education with ( = 0.02) and fathers' education with ( = 0.03) demonstrated better preventive behaviours and were less at risk of falls. Among the constructs of the PRECEDE model, the predisposing factors of knowledge ( = 0.04) and attitude ( = 0.001), enabling factors ( = 0.02), and environmental factors ( = 0.03) had a significant relationship with fall-preventive behaviours. According to the statistical results, the attitude construct was the predictor of students' fall- preventive behaviours. The study results indicated that fall-related injuries in the studied group are high. Additionally, the PRECEDE model can help identify factors associated with fall prevention among students. Given the significant role of behaviour and the school environment in fall prevention in this study, implementing appropriate interventions to enhance students' attitudes and knowledge and creating a safe school environment can be very beneficial and effective in improving fall-preventive behaviours.",

    title: 'A cost-effectiveness analysis of behavioural, pharmacological, and surgical obesity treatments in Canada.',
    abstract: 'AIMS: Effective weight management pharmacotherapies are a new alternative to bariatric surgery or health behaviour intervention (HBI) alone. Comparative cost-effectiveness evaluations can guide decision-making. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy (SG), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), semaglutide, tirzepatide, and HBI compared to no treatment in preventing cardiometabolic complications among Canadian adults with class III obesity.\n' +
      'MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a cohort-based Markov model with a 40-year time horizon. We examined cardiometabolic complications in 40-year-olds with class III obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m) without type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease at baseline. We compared SG, RYGB, semaglutide 2.4 mg, tirzepatide 15 mg, HBI, and no treatment. We obtained data on treatment effects, probabilities, utilities, and costs from published literature. We expressed effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and estimated costs from a Canadian public payer perspective. Outcomes included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) evaluated at a CAD $50 000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold.\n' +
      'RESULTS: RYGB and HBI were cost-effective strategies. HBI was cost-effective versus no treatment (ICER $14 279/QALY). RYGB demonstrated the highest QALYs (20.20) and was the most cost-effective strategy versus tirzepatide (ICER $44 667/QALY). Semaglutide and SG were strongly dominated due to higher costs and lower effectiveness. Tirzepatide was extendedly dominated by RYGB. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings and showed that lower drug prices could improve pharmacotherapy cost-effectiveness.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: RYGB and HBI are cost-effective for managing class III obesity. While RYGB provided the greatest health gains, access remains limited. Neither pharmacotherapy was cost-effective at current prices. Lower drug prices could significantly improve pharmacotherapy cost-effectiveness.',

    title: 'Medication Causes and Treatment of Delirium in Patients With and Without Dementia.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Medication associated with delirium in adult patients is poorly understood and considered both a predisposing and precipitating factor. Prescribing advice is lacking. This systematic review aims to collate evidence on medication risks in delirium associated with causation and treatment including mechanisms, treatment, and treatment alternatives in adult patients with and without dementia in an attempt to support prescribing decision-making and patient safety in healthcare practice.\n' +
      'METHODS: A literature review of CNIAHL, IPA, APA PsycArticles, PubMed, Cochrane Library, SAGE Education, Science Direct, SCOPUS, Web of Science Core Collection, National Grey Literature Collection, Google Scholar, Ovid, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations was performed from 2000 for articles published in English. Original, peer-reviewed studies, meta-analyses, systematic and narrative reviews, case reports, commentaries, editorials, and scientific communication focusing on medication-associated delirium risk in adult patients (≥ 18 years) were included. Title, abstract, and full-text screening were completed independently by two reviewers. CASP, MMAT, JBI, and the SANAR tool were used to assess reporting quality. The protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (ID: CRD42022366020).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Out of 3867 papers identified, 106 were included. Information about 20 different drug classes was reported. Despite a respectable quality rating, medication detail provided often lacks specificity about mechanisms of action, individual risk, dosage instructions, symptoms, and avoidable drug-drug combinations. Details on underlying mechanisms, pharmacological treatment, combinations, therapeutic alternatives, and medication associated with delirium in dementia patients were extracted.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: This summary offers the most detailed summary of medication-related information for delirium in patients with and without dementia to support prescribing decisions. While the detailed results can be used to support a multicomponent approach to delirium care, they also support the call for categorizing delirium into distinct etiological subgroups. The effect of medication on gut microbiome diversity and composition should be considered.',
