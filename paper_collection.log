    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Analyzing the User Experience of Virtual Pedagogy in Architecture Education',
    summary: 'This study aims to analyze the user experience of virtual pedagogy in architecture education. It seeks to gather valuable feedback and perceptions from teachers and students regarding the effectiveness, challenges, and benefits of virtual pedagogy. The study employs a quantitative research design using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the user experience, challenges, advantages, and overall satisfaction with virtual pedagogy in architecture education. The findings reveal the widespread use of tools and applications, such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and Zoom etc., for delivering both studio-based and non-studio-based courses in the virtual learning environment. The study highlights several challenges associated with virtual pedagogy, particularly for studio-based subjects, including the lack of in-person experience crucial for effective learning, difficulties in providing hands-on training, discouragement of active learning, and inadequate access to specialized tools and software. Additionally, the findings indicate that while virtual pedagogy offers flexibility and accessibility, it faces challenges in replicating the spontaneous interactions and hands-on nature of traditional in-person design studios.',

    title: 'Potential Efficacy of the MOVERS Professional Development Programme: A Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial.',
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: High-quality early childhood education (ECE) environments positively impact child outcomes. This study examined the potential efficacy of a professional development (PD) programme on improving the quality of the ECE movement environment and children's physical activity, motor, literacy and numeracy skills.\n" +
      "METHODS: A 6-month RCT involving 5 ECE services and 157 children (mean age 3.84 ± 0.61 years) was conducted. ECE services were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 3) or wait-list control group (n = 2). The PD comprised five monthly face-to-face sessions, including theory, practice and reflective thinking components. Outcomes included the quality of the ECE movement environment (MOVERS), children's gross motor skills (TGMD-2), physical activity (GT3X accelerometers), fine motor skills (ASQ-3), receptive vocabulary (PPVT-4) and numeracy (PENS). All outcomes were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Data were analysed using linear mixed models (SPSS, Version 26) and effect sizes were calculated. Educator engagement was collected using questionnaires.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Large effect sizes were reported for the quality of the ECE movement environment (d = 1.77-9.35). Medium to large effect sizes were reported for children's gross motor skills (d = 0.68-1.23), and small to medium effect sizes were reported for three subscales of the numeracy test (d = 0.43-0.63). In the intervention group, a significantly greater number of children moved from being at risk of delay or delayed to normal development in fine motor skills (Phi = 0.21). Educators reported that the PD content was relevant and clearly explained, highlighting the hands-on components as the most valued aspect.\n" +
      "CONCLUSION: The MOVERS PD pilot programme resulted in changes in educators' pedagogy and practice and in children's gross and fine motor skills and numeracy skills. Future studies with larger sample sizes will be important to confirm these results.",

    title: 'Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors use and the risks of genital and urinary tract infection: What should we know?',
    abstract: 'Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have convincingly demonstrated efficacy in reducing cardiovascular (CV) and renal complications in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. However, their use is also linked to the concern of some adverse events, the most common being genital and urinary tract infections (UTIs). This review summarizes the risks of genital and UTIs of SGLT2 inhibitors across large-scale clinical trials, meta-analyses, and real-world cohort studies. SGLT2 inhibitors are shown to significantly increase the risk of genital infections in clinical trials and real-world observational studies and marginally increase the risk of UTI in meta-analyses. We also discuss the potential pathogenesis of SGLT2 inhibitor-related infections and identify the susceptible risk factors. Since most genital and UTIs associated with SGLT2 inhibitors are mild and treatable and severe infections are rare, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is highly recommended in patients who meet the inclusion criteria of clinical trials, where the CV and renal benefits outweigh the infection risks. For all users of SGLT2 inhibitors, preventive strategies, patient education, and careful monitoring are essential to minimize the infection risks. Furthermore, we address an unmet need regarding SGLT2 inhibitors among vulnerable populations, such as older adults, frail, and immunocompromised patients, underscoring the importance of observational studies from the real-world data. Future research should focus on identifying the high-risk groups, developing SGLT2 inhibitors with a lower infection profile and establishing effective prevention strategies to mitigate the risk of genital and UTIs associated with these medications.',

    title: 'Body Art: A Study on Aesthetics and Postural Instability in Patients With Piercings.',
    abstract: "Body art is increasing in popularity around the world and may now be considered a mainstream activity even in Western society. In fact, nowadays, this practice has become customary, independent of social and cultural origin. The key motivating factors for obtaining body piercings are individual expression, personal image management, and art. Research in psychology and sociology has shown that the body is not considered acceptable if it is not covered with signs of belonging; that is the reason why an increasing number of people adorn themselves with often permanent decorations. As the prevalence of body art has increased, adverse health risks associated with body piercing have also been documented. In this work, after taking into consideration how piercings stimulate certain nerve endings and having specifically evaluated the areas pertaining to the trigeminal nerve and those related to the hypoglossal nerve, we carried out a clinical study on 26 patients according to the Integrated Postural Analysis (API) method by the Italian Association for Postural Occlusal Re-education (AIROP) on how facial piercings can influence the individual's posture. These evaluations led us to consider how the systems involved, postural and proprioceptive, can respond more or less intensely to the stimuli induced by piercings and that these cause alterations; furthermore, the responses to such solicitation can vary based on the onset and integration of the stimulus itself and the compensatory capacity of the neurophysiological system. We can thus affirm the existence of a well-founded correlation between postural alterations and the presence or removal of piercings, which can lead to manifestations referable to postural dysfunction syndromes (PDS).",

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Near-peer teaching (NPT), where students take on the role of educators for peers, is widely used in medical education to enhance the learning experience. We sought to explore the perspectives of near-peer tutors and the advantages of NPT among tutors and tutees in the context of exam preparation.\n' +
      'IMPLEMENTATION: We conducted NPT sessions for examination-oriented revision.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The feedback included rating the session and open-ended questions for scope and for free-text comments. Likert scale analysis revealed that almost 50% of tutees strongly agreed that tutors have a strong knowledge base, clarity of concepts, and an approachable attitude, and provided valuable resource materials. Free text comments were categorized into common themes: empathy and relatability, studying tips, drafting answers, tailored guidance, exam-specific approach, and precise revision.\n' +

    title: 'From Cadaver to Clinic: Transforming First-Year Anatomy Education Through Early Ultrasound Integration.',
    abstract: "Anatomy forms the foundational pillar of medical education, traditionally taught through cadaveric dissection. However, in light of evolving clinical demands and advancements in imaging technology, there is a growing need to enrich preclinical teaching methods. This article advocates for the structured integration of ultrasound into the first-year anatomy curriculum, in alignment with the National Medical Commission's competency-based framework, which emphasizes early clinical exposure and hands-on learning. While cadaveric dissection cultivates spatial orientation and tactile skills, it lacks the dynamic representation of physiological processes essential in modern diagnostic practice. Ultrasound bridges this gap by offering real-time, radiation-free visualization of living anatomy, enabling students to correlate theoretical knowledge with functional observations such as cardiac motion, vascular flow, and visceral organ activity. For students, this integration fosters improved spatial understanding, early diagnostic reasoning, and enhanced retention through experiential learning. For example, visualizing the pulsating vessels on a color Doppler or the dynamic movement of abdominal organs during sonographic sessions makes anatomical learning more engaging and clinically meaningful. Such exposure equips students with foundational skills in image acquisition and interpretation, preparing them for future clinical encounters from their formative years. For educators, ultrasound promotes active learning strategies and interdepartmental collaboration, encouraging innovation in teaching methodologies. It also complements didactic lectures and dissection sessions, creating a hybrid model that strengthens knowledge transfer and long-term retention. From a healthcare perspective, early ultrasound training helps develop clinicians who are better prepared to identify normal and pathological findings, particularly in primary care and resource-limited settings. This aligns with the vision of producing Indian medical graduates capable of serving as first-contact physicians in the community. Furthermore, literature evidence, including systematic reviews, demonstrates improved academic performance, diagnostic confidence, and clinical preparedness among students trained with ultrasound-enhanced curricula. In conclusion, incorporating ultrasound into first-year anatomy education is not merely an enhancement but a necessary evolution. It addresses limitations of traditional methods, meets regulatory mandates, and directly benefits students, educators, and the healthcare system. This integrated approach ensures medical graduates are equipped with both foundational anatomical knowledge and the clinical competencies required in contemporary practice.",

    title: 'Evaluating the Quality of Online Information on Percutaneous Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy (PELD) Using the DISCERN Instrument.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure increasingly referenced in patient-oriented websites. However, the quality of such online health information is inconsistent. This study evaluates the quality of Italian-language web content on PELD using the DISCERN tool.\n' +
      `METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on 25 May 2025 using the Italian-language interface of Google (Google LLC, Mountain View, California, United States) with the keywords "PELD," "discectomia endoscopica percutanea," and "ernia del disco PELD." Twenty websites targeted at the general public were selected. Each was independently assessed using the 16-item DISCERN instrument by two trained reviewers. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient.\n` +
      "RESULTS: The mean overall DISCERN score across the 20 websites was 39.5 (SD = 8.7) out of 80, indicating moderate-to-low quality. High-scoring domains included clarity of procedural explanation (mean = 4.2/5), while critical aspects such as citation of sources (mean = 2.1/5) and discussion of uncertainties (mean = 1.7/5) were underrepresented. Cohen's kappa was 0.82, indicating strong agreement between reviewers.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Online Italian-language resources on PELD exhibit moderate quality and frequently omit essential components such as treatment risks and alternative options. Enhancing transparency and evidence citation is essential to improve the quality of patient education materials.',

    title: "Impact of Simulation-Based Medical Education on Pre-clerkship Medical Students' Confidence in Key Areas of Clinical Competence: An Exploratory Pre- and Post-survey Study.",
    abstract: "Background Medical education is adapting to meet the growing demands of healthcare and patient care complexities. Traditional clinical training often relies on limited patient encounters, which may not fully develop clinical competence. Simulation-based medical education (SBME) offers controlled, immersive environments for practicing clinical skills and decision-making without risking patient safety. While SBME has been well-studied in advanced training, its effectiveness in first- and second-year medical students remains underexplored. This study aims to explore and quantify pre-clerkship medical students' perspectives on how SBME impacts confidence in clinical decision-making, communication, and clinical skills, compared to traditional learning methods alone. Methods This pre- and post-survey-based study assessed the impact of simulation (SIM) on students' self-reported confidence in clinical decision-making, communication, and clinical skills. Six simulation scenarios that aligned with the undergraduate medical curriculum of one Canadian institution were conducted from October 2023 to March 2024. Participants completed pre- and post-simulation surveys using 5-point Likert scales. A total of 67 surveys were analyzed. Results  All 67 surveys were analyzed (35 pre-, 32 post-simulation) using one-sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests. Pre-simulation responses indicated low baseline confidence, with only one item rated above neutrality. Post-simulation ratings showed statistically significant improvements across all domains (p < 0.01). Students also reported that they perceived simulation as more effective than traditional didactic learning in preparing them for clinical practice.  Conclusions This exploratory study suggests that simulation-based education can enhance pre-clerkship students' confidence in clinical decision-making, communication, and procedural skills, domains often underdeveloped at this stage of training. These findings offer early evidence that high-fidelity simulation may accelerate perceived clinical readiness. However, due to the small, self-selected sample, non-parallel survey design, and reliance on subjective outcomes, results should be treated as exploratory. Further multi-site studies using objective measures are needed to assess long-term impact on knowledge and skill retention as well as clinical performance.",

    title: 'Attitudes of People With Chronic Musculoskeletal Disorders Towards Telerehabilitation: A Cross-Sectional Survey.',
    abstract: "Introduction Chronic musculoskeletal disorders have a significant impact on morbidity, daily functioning, and quality of life. They represent a key priority for intervention, particularly in the context of an aging population and increased life expectancy. Recently, telerehabilitation has been shown to be effective; however, the attitudes of this clinical population toward telerehabilitation have not yet been thoroughly explored in the literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, beliefs, and willingness of people with chronic musculoskeletal disorders in Greece to use telerehabilitation. Materials and methods In this cross-sectional study, 160 individuals (95 women and 65 men) with a mean age of 44.1 years and diagnosed with chronic musculoskeletal problems completed a survey. The sample included participants with low back pain (56, 36.9%), overuse tendinopathies (30, 18.8%), neck pain (34, 21.3%), arthritis (14, 8.8%), and upper back pain (3, 1.9%). Participants were recruited from physiotherapy clinics in Athens. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of West Attica, Greece. The survey questionnaire included 26 items (16 general and 10 telerehabilitation-specific) covering demographic background, familiarization with technology, overall perceptions, willingness to follow telerehabilitation, and preferred mode of delivery. Results The survey was first pilot-tested, and relevant modifications were made. The final version demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.648). Principal Components Analysis (PCA) revealed a three-factor solution, familiarization with technology, preferred mode of telerehabilitation, and willingness to attend telerehabilitation, with eigenvalues of 2.19, 1.98, and 1.22 respectively, explaining 53.97% of total variance. Overall, fewer than half of the participants (59, 36.9%) reported willingness to follow telerehabilitation. The preferred mode of delivery was video-based sessions. Their perspective towards telerehabilitation appeared to be related to seeking information about their problem online (X  11.1, p=0.03) and technological familiarity (Likelihood Ratio, p=0.048) but not with the specific type of musculoskeletal condition (X =12.7, p=ns). Conclusion Telerehabilitation, which leverages technology to deliver rehabilitation services remotely, is indeed seeing its culture constructed and integrated into healthcare systems. However, this survey highlights barriers based on patient attitudes, as less than half of respondents were receptive to the approach. Higher education levels, greater familiarity with technology, and a tendency to seek medical information online were associated with a greater willingness to engage in telerehabilitation. Further research involving larger samples and populations from rural areas across Greece is needed to assess the generalizability of these findings, particularly in regions where health equity is challenged by limited access and technological disparities.",
