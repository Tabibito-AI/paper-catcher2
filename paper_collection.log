    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

Their ability to adapt learning to users’ individual needs results in improvements in performance, engagement and self-efficacy contributing to a deeper understanding of the topics covered. The use of chatbots in learning is pushing the scientific community to examine the potential and also the relative risks of these tools. This study aims to preliminarily investigate the level of knowledge and propensity to use ChatGPT to understand the key factors influencing the adoption of these tools among university students. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to over 300 students at the University of Salerno (Italy), involving various faculties to explore how the field of study influences interest in using ChatGPT. The results will allow profiling of students based on the variables examined, revealing their level of knowledge and attitude towards using ChatGPT for educational purposes. This research, involving students from humanities and scientific disciplines, underscores their crucial role in shaping the future of educational technologies. Practical and theoretical implications could lead to more effective and personalized forms of learning, revolutionizing the education and learning sector.',

    title: 'Analyzing the User Experience of Virtual Pedagogy in Architecture Education',
    summary: 'This study aims to analyze the user experience of virtual pedagogy in architecture education. It seeks to gather valuable feedback and perceptions from teachers and students regarding the effectiveness, challenges, and benefits of virtual pedagogy. The study employs a quantitative research design using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the user experience, challenges, advantages, and overall satisfaction with virtual pedagogy in architecture education. The findings reveal the widespread use of tools and applications, such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and Zoom etc., for delivering both studio-based and non-studio-based courses in the virtual learning environment. The study highlights several challenges associated with virtual pedagogy, particularly for studio-based subjects, including the lack of in-person experience crucial for effective learning, difficulties in providing hands-on training, discouragement of active learning, and inadequate access to specialized tools and software. Additionally, the findings indicate that while virtual pedagogy offers flexibility and accessibility, it faces challenges in replicating the spontaneous interactions and hands-on nature of traditional in-person design studios.',

    title: "Learning Variability Network Exchange (LEVANTE): A Global Framework for Measuring Children's Learning Variability Through Collaborative Data Sharing.",
    abstract: "Despite the ubiquity of variation in child development within individuals, across groups, and across tasks, timescales, and contexts, dominant methods in developmental science and education research still favor group averages, short snapshots of time, and single environments. The Learning Variability Network Exchange (LEVANTE) is a framework designed to enable coordinated data collection by research teams worldwide, with the goal of measuring variability in children's learning and development. The LEVANTE measure set aims to capture variability in learning outcomes (literacy and numeracy) as well as in core cognitive and social constructs. LEVANTE will yield a large, open access longitudinal dataset for long-term research use, both creating a multidisciplinary research network and facilitating the science of learning variability.",

    title: "Podiatrists' Reflections on Content and Delivery of Their Pre-Registration Podiatry Programme at a Regional University in New South Wales, Australia: A Survey of Graduates.",
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Understanding podiatrists' perceptions of their undergraduate education is important to ensure that educational content and delivery meets the needs of the current workforce to inform future planning. This study aims to explore podiatrists' perceptions of their undergraduate podiatry training at the University of Newcastle, Australia, and their preferences regarding educational content and delivery.\n" +
      "METHODS: We conducted an online survey of podiatry graduates from the University of Newcastle, Australia. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test to compare responses between groups. Qualitative responses were analysed using inductive content analysis.\n" +
      'RESULTS: A total of 114 podiatrists responded. Nail avulsions, business management and modifying orthoses were perceived as being given insufficient time and focus in undergraduate training, with a higher proportion of private (71%) compared to public (33%) podiatrists reporting business management as lacking (p = 0.02). There was strong support for embedding endorsed scheduled medicines training within the programme (80%) and for delivering theoretical content face-to-face rather than online. Inductive content analysis revealed four areas to be emphasised in future curricula: modern technologies, biomechanics, wound care and routine podiatric care. Potential strategies to reduce examination stress included mock assessments, changed assessment weighting, reduced exam structure rigidity and reducing assessor bias.\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insights into Australian podiatrists' preferences for pre-registration curricula. Topics to emphasise in future curricula at the University of Newcastle, Australia, include greater manual skills and business training, modern technologies, biomechanics and routine podiatric care. Our results suggest exercising caution when substituting face-to-face with online learning. These findings provide valuable guidance for future curricula in a context of declining student numbers and increasing healthcare demands.",

    title: `Multi-cohort evaluation of "Don't know" responders to self-report oral health questions: Implications for etiologic research.`,
    abstract: `BACKGROUND: Self-reported data can extend the reach of oral health research, but "Don't know" responses may threaten validity. We explored characteristics of participants who responded "Don't know" to a periodontal health question across three distinct cohorts.\n` +
      `METHODS: We used data from three questionnaire-based observational studies, namely, the Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) (N = 10,996), the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS) (N = 479), and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (N = 15,502), to evaluate responses to questionnaire items related to periodontal health (e.g., "Has a dentist or dental hygienist ever told you that you have periodontitis or gum disease?"). We compared sociodemographic and behavioral factors across each response category ("Yes," "No," "Don't know"). We used Monte Carlo simulation to create multiple datasets of 100,000 participants under different scenarios to calculate the percent change in observed effect estimates in analyses using the full cohort compared to analytic cohorts excluding "Don't know" respondents.\n` +
      `RESULTS: "Don't know" prevalences ranged from 1.6% to 4.1%. We observed differences between "Don't know" responders and those who answered "Yes" or "No" across all three cohorts. "Don't know" responders were more likely to have lower educational attainment, lower income, and reduced engagement with oral healthcare services. We observed substantial bias in complete-case effect estimates in some simulated scenarios. Bias was larger when the underlying population prevalence of "Don't know" responses was higher.\n` +
      `CONCLUSIONS: "Don't know" responders had distinct patterns of sociodemographic characteristics and oral healthcare engagement. The degree of bias in complete-case analysis was dependent on simulated factors.\n` +
      `PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Research about oral health often asks people to answer questions about their teeth and gums. Sometimes people respond that they "Don't know" the answer to these questions, which can make data challenging for researchers to analyze. In this study, we used three different data sources to look at whether there were particular characteristics that were more common among people who said they "Don't know" in response to a question about their gum health. "Don't know" responses were not very common in any of the three groups, ranging from 1.6% in a representative survey of people in the United States to 4.1% in a group of women in the United States and Canada trying to become pregnant. In all three groups, people who said "Don't know" had a lower household income, less education, and were less likely to have seen a dentist recently. We also used simulated datasets to evaluate when excluding people who responded "Don't know" would be expected to cause the most bias in analyses. The expected bias increased with the number of "Don't know" responses in the data.`,

    title: 'Factors influencing tooth loss over 9-11 years in young individuals with periodontitis.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Herein, we aimed to identify factors associated with tooth loss over a 9- to 11-year period in young individuals with periodontitis, with a specific focus on the impact of patient compliance. The secondary outcome was to identify factors associated with discontinuation of active periodontal treatment.\n' +
      'METHODS: This retrospective register-based cohort study included 446 patients under the age of 36, diagnosed with periodontitis at 2 periodontal clinics, between 2003 and 2009. Variables were collected from digital dental records combined with 2 national health registers. The follow-up period was between 2009 and 2019. Negative binomial and logistic regression analyses identified factors significantly associated with tooth loss and discontinuation of periodontal treatment.\n' +
      'RESULTS: The majority of patients had lost none or maximum of 3 teeth due to periodontitis, while 3.6% had lost ≥ 10 teeth. The mean number of teeth lost due to periodontitis was 1.3 (range 0-26). Generalized periodontitis, stage IV, low level of education, smoking, and discontinuation of active periodontal treatment (APT) were significantly correlated with tooth loss. The variables periodontal stage, low level of education together with low income were correlated to discontinuation of APT.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: In this register-based study, discontinuation of APT, severe periodontal disease, smoking, and low level of education increased the risk for tooth loss. Additionally, low education level, low income, and severe periodontal disease were also significantly associated with discontinuation of APT.\n' +
      'PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: There are few studies focusing on tooth loss in young individuals with periodontitis. To increase knowledge on this issue, this register-based study focused on 446 individuals who were younger than 36 years of age at time of their periodontal diagnosis. During a follow-up period from 2009 to 2019, most individuals lost few or no teeth, while a minority accounted for most of the tooth losses. Patients with a generalized severe periodontal disease, low educational level, and who smoked were at the highest risk of tooth loss. Additionally, interruption of periodontal treatment was observed to be more common in patients with severe disease.',

    title: 'Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Among First-Time Mothers: A Mixed-Methods Study Comparing Spontaneous and Assisted Conceptions in Turkey.',
    abstract: 'AIM: This mixed-method study aimed to examine the relationship between mode of conception and breastfeeding self-efficacy among first-time mothers in Turkey, comparing outcomes between those who conceived spontaneously and those who conceived through assisted reproductive technologies (ART). A secondary objective was to explore the lived experiences of women with low breastfeeding self-efficacy in both groups.\n' +
      "METHODS: Using an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design, quantitative data were collected from 100 mothers, 50 with spontaneous pregnancies and 50 with ART-conceived pregnancies, using a validated breastfeeding self-efficacy scale. In the qualitative phase, in-depth interviews were conducted with six mothers who scored low on the scale or reported breastfeeding difficulties. The qualitative component was guided by Dennis' Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Framework.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Quantitative findings revealed significantly higher breastfeeding self-efficacy scores among mothers with spontaneous pregnancies compared to those who conceived through ART. Qualitative analysis identified key influencing factors such as emotional adjustment to motherhood, perceived social expectations and physical challenges related to breastfeeding. A critical gap in targeted breastfeeding education and postnatal support was noted across both groups.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscore the need for individualized, culturally sensitive breastfeeding interventions, particularly for mothers who have conceived through ART. Tailored support strategies addressing both psychological and physical aspects of the postpartum experience may enhance breastfeeding outcomes in this growing population.',

    title: 'Photoprotection in Skin of Color: A Scoping Review of Barriers, Behaviors, and Pediatric Considerations.',
    abstract: 'Individuals with skin of color (SOC) can sunburn and develop skin cancer, often presenting at advanced stages with higher morbidity and melanoma-related mortality. However, patient education on photoprotection for SOC populations remains limited. This scoping review investigated the benefits of photoprotection and the factors influencing sun protective behaviors in SOC populations. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched from January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2022, using the overarching terms of "SOC," "skin cancer," and "photoprotection." Original, English-language studies were included, while non-human and incomplete studies were excluded. The review found that while photoprotection benefits SOC populations, individuals within these groups exhibit lower knowledge of and participation in sun-protective behaviors. This gap is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including cultural values, family dynamics, gender, education, and societal norms surrounding beauty. Misconceptions about innate sun protection contribute to this gap. To address this, culturally relevant education, community engagement, healthcare integration, and increased representation of SOC in dermatological research are essential to improving sun-safe habits in these communities.',

    title: "Forward Outlook on Oral Health: The American Association of Public Health Dentistry's 2025 Research Agenda for Dental Public Health.",
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: Dental public health (DPH) research is crucial in improving and promoting community oral health by generating and translating new knowledge into practice. Since the last AAPHD research agenda in 1992, the DPH field has made significant advancements. This research agenda aims to outline key research areas in DPH, including priority topics and evidence gaps in our scientific understanding of factors influencing population oral health and oral health equity.\n' +
      'METHODS: A workgroup under the AAPHD Council on Scientific Information (CSI) surveyed 503 AAPHD members in September 2021 to gather feedback on seven draft research objectives. The survey used a Likert scale to assess agreement and included open-ended suggestions.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 115 AAPHD members responded to the survey, resulting in a response rate of about 23%. Six of the seven objectives were agreed or strongly agreed upon by respondents as important areas of focus for DPH research. The final research agenda includes six key areas: oral health policy and legislation, delivery system innovations and care models, oral health workforce, DPH education, social determinants of health, and epidemiology and surveillance systems. The research agenda describes advancements and gaps in these areas, existing evidence, example priority topics, and research questions.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The AAPHD encourages DPH partners, including federal agencies, DPH organizations, foundations, and dental associations, to advocate for, support, use, and fund high-quality DPH research. This support is crucial for translating emerging evidence into oral health improvements and equity across the diverse US communities.',

      'MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was live birth rate.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Regarding live birth, rates in normal weight women were initially lower for metabolically unhealthy normal weight versus metabolically healthy normal weight (44.6% vs. 48.6%), but this was not significant after multivariate adjustment. In obese women, live birth rates were similar between metabolically unhealthy obese and metabolically healthy obese (41.5% vs. 43.9%), with no adjusted difference. For secondary outcomes, metabolically unhealthy normal weight patients had lower biochemical pregnancy rates than metabolically healthy normal weight (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76-0.98); high blood pressure was a significant risk factor for this outcome in metabolically unhealthy normal weight (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.98).\n' +

    title: 'Approaches to Addressing Pediatric Cancer Treatment Refusal Beyond Legal Action.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Parental refusal and abandonment of recommended treatment in pediatric oncology can have significant consequences for patients and cause moral and emotional distress for clinicians. We sought to describe the spectrum of approaches to treatment refusal and abandonment that pediatric oncologists utilize when trying to avoid legal intervention, prior to deciding to seek legal intervention, and/or when legal intervention had been deemed inappropriate.\n' +
      'METHODS: US-based pediatric oncologists were recruited to participate in qualitative interviews through purposive and referral sampling to maximize diversity. The semi-structured interview guide covered types of conflicts encountered; factors and approaches considered in response; effects of treatment refusal, personally and professionally; role of ethical frameworks and legal requirements; and the resources needed to manage refusal cases. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded using applied thematic analysis within the overall framework of grounded theory.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Participants reported using multiple tactics comprising three themes: logistics of communication, establishment of trust, and negotiation and compromise. They also described resources utilized, discussed how their experiences changed their practice, and what they would advise colleagues in the future, and identified barriers to successful resolution. Most participants did not have institutional policies or processes beyond the use of ethics consultation and desired more in-depth preparation and guidance.\n' +
