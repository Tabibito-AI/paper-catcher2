    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    abstract: 'ABSTRACT In this paper we ask, what is mainstream economics education conveying to its students? Standard mainstream economics textbooks treat the environment as a specialist issue in addition to standard concerns and based on solutions that conform to those standard concerns. When viewed as socialisation for students this is a major problem. To illustrate the problems we set out key aspects of the standard format, and draw attention to the structure and contents from two well-known textbooks. Standard textbooks convey the impression that the ‘environmental issue’ is appropriately incorporated and exhibit two complacency-creating features. First, fundamental problems (acute global ecological breakdown, biodiversity loss, climate change crisis etc), issues and urgency cannot be adequately conveyed to students within this way of framing economics. Second, specific theory and policy solutions suggest that the problem is well in hand. We illustrate using the theory of negative externalities.',

    title: 'Enhancing Sustainable Fintech Education: Investigating the Role of Smartphones in Empowering Economic Development in Jordan',
    summary: 'This study investigates the transformative role of smartphones in the financial technology (Fintech) industry in Jordan, focusing on how mobile technology enhances financial education and promotes broader adoption of Fintech services. This adoption plays a vital role in advancing specific United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), by fostering financial inclusion, enhancing digital financial literacy, and enabling equitable access to Fintech education through smartphones. Qualitative data was collected via an online survey distributed through social media platforms and emails, allowing for a broad and inclusive reach. The questionnaire targeted the overall public, or mobile phone users in Jordan, with no age restriction, to achieve diverse opinions regarding mobile-based financial literacy and Fintech adoption. One hundred eighty-nine valid responses were obtained, forming the basis for statistical analysis. The study explores the direct correlations between educational initiatives facilitated by smartphones and the subsequent adoption of Fintech services, considering the moderating effects of digital literacy and the regulatory environment. The results show that increased digital literacy enhances the effectiveness of Fintech applications, thus promoting financial inclusivity and literacy. The structural model explains 75.4% of the variance in smartphone usage for financial education (R 2  = 0.754). Hypothesis testing confirms significant positive effects, with Fintech adoption (β = 0.033, p < 0.001), educational outreach (β = 0.040, p < 0.001), and innovation in educational Fintech products (β = 0.043, p < 0.001) associated with increased smartphone usage in education. The study highlights the need for advancements in user-friendly and accessible financial services, underlining the critical role of regulatory frameworks and digital literacy in fostering a secure and inclusive financial ecosystem. These findings are consistent with and support the SDGs, providing individuals with information and tools to maintain long-term financial stability.',

    title: 'Education and Music Intervention to Reduce Anxiety (EMIRA) in cardiac catheterization: intervention development',
    summary: 'Background Anxiety related to cardiac catheterization (ARCC) is highly prevalent and most severe in the immediate preoperative period. ARCC is associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption, blood pressure variability, and increased risk of arrhythmias, leading to higher rates of intraoperative complications and worse physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning. Objective To describe a nurse-led complex intervention (CI) designed to reduce ARCC in adults before a cardiac catheterization (CC). Methods To design the intervention, a concept analysis yielded the identification of ARCC antecedents and attributes, based on which CI components and objectives were determined. For each component, CI procedures, mode of delivery, and dose were established based on empirical evidence. The CI was reported according to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist. Results The Education and Music Intervention to Reduce Anxiety (EMIRA) consists of two components. The educational component provides the essential information regarding CC purpose, catheterization laboratory features, and what to expect before, during, and after the procedure. The musical component provides individuals with a feeling of comfort and relaxation. EMIRA is delivered in one 30-min session using an audiovisual format. EMIRA’s expected primary outcome is a decreased state anxiety level. Additionally, EMIRA might reduce blood pressure, heart and respiratory rates, and chest pain. Conclusions EMIRA is a CI developed with methodological rigor. Future studies should evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of EMIRA.',

    title: 'Training for dementia care and support in rural and remote Australia: appraisals from a nationwide workforce survey',
    summary: 'Background Dementia is a growing challenge to health and aged care worldwide and is the leading cause of disease burden in older Australians. High-quality person-centred care of people with dementia and support for their family caregivers require a trained multidisciplinary health and aged care workforce. Compared with major cities in Australia, rural and remote areas encounter greater challenges in workforce recruitment and retention. Moreover, these areas have distinctive distance-related barriers to workforce training and a higher proportion of aged and First Nations people at elevated risk of developing dementia. We designed and distributed a survey to investigate the perspectives on training among rural and remote health and aged care workers providing dementia care in diverse occupations and settings. Methods After piloting, the online survey was promoted to rural and remote organisations and professional networks nationwide. The instrument included multiple-choice and ordered-scale items on respondents’ dementia care self-rating and appraisal of their current workplace dementia care training, as well as items categorising their demographic characteristics, main work role, main workplace setting, and geographical site. Analysis incorporated description of respondent characteristics and estimation along with graphical presentation of response proportions for ordered-scale items, with differences among key respondent subgroups (i.e., workplace setting, remoteness, and main role) investigated using crude and multivariable robust Poisson regression models. Results There were 558 respondents from residential aged care, community/primary care and hospital settings across all Australian states and territories. The majority (61.7%) were from degree-requiring health professional/management positions, and 27.4% were certificate-requiring workers (predominantly personal care assistants and enrolled nurses). A majority considered that the dementia care provided in their current workplace was inadequate overall and specifically in relation to First Nations and culturally and linguistically diverse clients. Respondents noted organisational resource limitations impeding workers’ participation in training, and insufficient opportunities for input into determining priorities for training content and delivery. Hospital/acute care-based workers had the least favourable self-ratings and represented the highest proportion of respondents reporting shortcomings of training. Conclusions Health and aged care workers in rural and remote Australia perceive substantial shortcomings in the dementia care training provided by their workplace.',

    title: 'Use of brain-computer interface in educational paradigm',
    summary: "Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has been utilized in research for several decades. Using BCI, a person interacts with their environment by controlling it using their brain signals. Brain signals can also help determine the level of confusion among students. In this study, we discuss using BCI to measure students' concentration levels. Using student data obtained from Kaggle, a publicly accessible data source, we deployed a variety of deep learning and machine learning algorithms that include support vector machines, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, multi-layer perceptron, deep neural networks, and bidirectional long short-term memory were used in our comparative analysis. We proposed 1D CNN and DNN models in this research study. Although LSTM performs better when time stamps are present in the data, our analysis of the findings revealed that deep neural networks performed better in this case, with an accuracy of 99%. Another 1D CNN model is proposed to compare its performance with the DNN model. We found that the 1DCNN model is more stable than the DNN model but has slightly lower accuracy, i.e., 95%. Additionally, deep learning algorithms typically employ the rectified linear unit (ReLU) to mitigate vanishing gradient issues, resulting in a well-performing model. In contrast, 'RELU' has reversed the findings of BiSTM in this investigation, reducing accuracy from 82 to 67%. We have also conducted numerous experiments to identify the optimal parameter values for deep neural networks (DNNs) that yield the highest accuracy, specifically 99.9%. Therefore, DNN can be utilized in a real-time setting for the development of a confusion detection system, and BCI can be incorporated into the educational paradigm to reap the benefits of technological progress.",

    title: 'Perspectives on AI literacy in Middle School Classrooms: An Integrative Review',
    summary: 'AI literacy in school education is booming within the scientific discourse of AI in education. How AI literacy is currently being framed serves diverse educational, political, and commercial purposes influencing how we imagine postdigital classrooms today and in the future. More importantly, how AI literacy emerges in primary education notably impacts how children understand AI and their own agency in a society where AI is ubiquitous. This study reviews how scientific literature conceptualises AI literacy, focusing on middle school students. An AI-adapted literacy framework (GeST) is used in the analysis to distinguish three perspectives of AI literacy (Generic, Situated, and Transformative). Forty-four papers from 2016–2024 were included in the final descriptive and qualitative analysis, showing an exponential growth in scientific papers. While still vaguely defined and poorly theorised, AI literacy materialises into different AI curricula and technology-supported teaching activities. The GeST analysis indicates that AI literacy is primarily viewed as a set of measurable skills related to generalisable theoretical knowledge that is expected to make children more competitive in a globalised and technologised world. Although some papers consider empowering students with specific competencies to challenge the AI development, critical considerations of AI in education is less visible. The paper highlights the necessity to steer the conceptualisation of AI literacy to put a stronger emphasis on critical orientations that enable students as well as teachers to examine claims about AI, and pose ethical questions to its adoption and use in classrooms and beyond.',

    title: 'Sexuality Education Responding to the Same-Sex Marriage Policy: Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting in a Taiwanese Undergraduate University Course',
    summary: 'Introduction Research in Taiwan regarding courses promoting equality for same-sex family parenting is critical as Taiwan celebrates one year of legalising adoptions for same-sex couples and universities attempt to implement gender diversity initiatives. The purpose of this study was to examine how university students’ attitudes toward same-sex family parenting changed regarding individual and normative opposition, following a semester course in responding to the same-sex marriage policy. Methods Ninety-eight Taiwanese undergraduate students participated in a contact theory and self-reflection-driven course. They discussed gender equality and same-sex marriage policy, attended the Taipei LGBT + Pride Parade, and made public presentations regarding their reflections. The pre-test was administered in mid-September 2018, and the post-test was administered at the end of December 2018. Results The researchers identified that normative opposition was significantly stronger compared to individual opposition; following the course, both males and females’ individual and normative opposition significantly decreased. Conclusions This research emphasises the need for further development of courses focusing on attitudes toward parenting in same-sex families, to identify a curriculum which decreases stereotypes and develops support. Moreover, it is important to identify where gender and sexual orientation stereotypes overlap as both impact same-sex families. Policy Implications. This study highlights the need for integrating empathy-based gender and sexuality education into university curricula. Policies should support courses that include contact with same-sex families and reflective activities to reduce bias. Institutionalizing such programs can foster inclusive attitudes and strengthen support for same-sex parenting in Taiwan’s evolving social landscape.',

    title: 'What makes a classmate a peer? Examining which peers matter in NYC elementary schools',
    summary: 'This paper identifies and estimates the effects of student-level social spillovers on standardized test performance in New York City (NYC) elementary schools. We leverage student demographic data to construct within-classroom social networks based on shared student characteristics, such as gender or ethnicity. Rather than aggregate shared characteristics into a single network matrix, we specify additively separate network matrices for each shared characteristic and estimate city-wide peer effects for each one. Our work is based on the common assumption that more shared characteristics between peers imply stronger network connections. We test this hypothesis using a collection of common and novel characteristics, answering which shared characteristics exhibit the strongest peer effects and by how much. Conditional on being in the same classroom, we find that the most influential networks are shared gender and primary language spoken at home. We show that altering classroom composition changes the impact of these networks. Particularly, low linguistic diversity is correlated with low impact for shared language. As the influence of the shared language network declines, the gender network becomes more influential, indicating that these networks are substitutes. We discuss identification of the model and its implications for within- and between-group test performance gaps along several demographic traits.',

We argue that personification can act as a boundary object to open up new aesthetic possibilities for science and education, toward an aesthetics of personhood. Drawing on philosophy, Indigenous knowledge systems, feminist science studies, and emerging scientific fields, we propose a relational notion of personhood for science education that is inclusive of human and more-than-human beings. We position relational personhood in science education as an aesthetic shift that can reconfigure what is possible, visible, and say-able in science education, ultimately contributing to a science education that is ‘fit for the future’ and respons-able to the challenges of the Anthropocene.',

    title: 'NgodingSeru.com: an adaptive e-learning system with gamification to enhance programming problem-solving skills for vocational high school students',
    summary: 'This study investigates the integration of adaptive e-learning and gamification through a platform called NgodingSeru.com to improve problem-solving skills in programming among vocational high school students. The adaptive system offers personalized learning by adjusting task difficulty to student’s proficiency levels, while gamification elements such as missions, points, rankings, and rewards aim to sustain student engagement. A mixed-methods design was applied using an explanatory sequential approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative findings show a statistically significant improvement in student’s problem-solving performance, with average scores increasing from 61.7 to 74.2—an improvement of approximately 20.2%. The effect size was large, with a Cohen’s d of 0.90, indicating a substantial practical impact of the adaptive gamification-based e-learning system. The qualitative phase revealed that students perceived the system as motivating, enjoyable, and supportive of their learning needs. Key gamification features and adaptive feedback mechanisms contributed significantly to student’s engagement and persistence in completing programming challenges. In particular, case-based challenges and logic-based problems effectively strengthen student’s analytical thinking and the application of programming concepts. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating adaptive and gamified learning environments in fostering essential problem-solving skills in programming education.',

    title: 'The effect of educational intervention based on the health action model on safe use of pesticides in Iranian farmers',
    summary: 'The health risks associated with excessive pesticide use have adversely affected agricultural products and human health, raising global concerns about the safety of consumers and agricultural workers. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of an educational intervention based on the health action model (HAM) on summer workers’ safety behaviors regarding pesticide use. The present quasi-experimental study involved an experiment and a control group. A multi-stage random cluster sampling method was employed to select 100 farms from a total of 1000 summer vegetable farms in Mashhad through a simple randomization process. Then, 300 eligible workers were selected and allocated into an experimental group and a control group. The educational intervention consisted of two focus group discussion sessions and eight training sessions making educational training based on the HAM. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 16, and tests were chosen based on the distribution of variables. Both parametric and equivalent non-parametric tests were applied at a significance level of 0.05. Following the intervention, the mean scores of all constructs in the experimental group improved significantly, with the exception of the normative system. The educational intervention-based HAM had a significant effect ( p  < 0.05) on safety behavior outcomes and all knowledge-related dimensions (safe place and pesticide use, personal safety during spraying, personal safety after spraying, pesticide side effects) in the intervention group compared with the control group after the intervention, and in their change from baseline to follow-up in all scores. The mean score of safety behavior in the pre-intervention increased from 5.2 ± 1.27 to 8.1 ± 0.82 in the follow-up. However, no statistically significant difference was found in the control group. The educational program based on HAM and knowledge-related dimensions significantly improved safety behaviors among farmers and agricultural workers regarding pesticide use. This study emphasizes the need for implementing theory based- educational programs for diverse agricultural workers to enhance safety practices and reduce health risks associated with pesticide exposure.',

    title: 'Mapping shifts in employment patterns in the Northern Gulf of Mexico due to sea-level rise.',
    abstract: 'This paper investigates the far-reaching effects of climate change on coastal communities, focusing on sea-level rise (SLR) and its impact on housing stability and employment across diverse sectors and geographical areas. We examine the repercussions of varying SLR scenarios on the population and employment associated with various economic sectors in the Northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), a topic on which there are notable gaps in the literature. Our analysis predicts that 2.3% of current employees will become vulnerable by 2100 to SLR alone, increasing to 4% when coupled with a category 1 hurricane and 18% with a category 5 hurricane, assuming no adaptation measures. If urbanization, employment growth, and housing choices-driven by proximity to workplaces-remain unchanged, these percentages will be 8, 11, and 34% for projected employees. Industries such as construction, health care, and accommodation and food services are particularly at risk due to SLR alone along the Northern Gulf Coast. The threat extends to other sectors like retail trade, transportation, and education across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida, especially under category 5 hurricanes. Many employees in these sectors currently reside near shorelines, suggesting significant workforce relocation will be required. Vulnerability to economic losses will rise among individuals aged 30 to 54, with nearly half of at-risk projected employees belonging to higher earning groups. While these individuals may have resources to manage relocation, remaining elements of the population are socially vulnerable due to limited financial means and alternatives, highlighting the need for targeted support and equitable risk mitigation.',

    title: 'Harnessing Advanced Imaging Technologies in Robotic Urological Surgery Requires Specialized and Structured Training.',
    abstract: 'UNLABELLED: In recent years, the integration of advanced technologies in surgery has transformed health care, with urology consistently pioneering these innovations. Unlike the structured drug development process, surgical advancements follow a distinct pathway, exemplified by the Innovation, Development, Exploration, Assessment, and Long-term follow-up (IDEAL) framework, which supports safe, evidence-based innovation. Complementary technologies, including three-dimensional (3D) models and augmented reality (AR), have emerged as transformative tools in robotic urological surgery, particularly for complex cases. These technologies enhance surgical planning, intraoperative navigation, and postoperative outcomes, especially in kidney and prostate cancer surgeries. Despite growing adoption, structured training programs tailored to 3D and AR applications remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey of participants from the 12th Techno Urology Meeting (2024) to evaluate the current use and training needs for these technologies. Among 126 respondents, the majority utilized 3D models (64.5%) and AR (40.3%) in clinical practice, highlighting their role in robotic partial nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy. Respondents overwhelmingly emphasized the need for dedicated multidisciplinary courses with hands-on training and proficiency-based progression methodologies. This study underscores the necessity of structured, technology-specific training to maximize the potential of 3D models and AR in robotic urology, offering critical insights for advancing surgical education and improving patient care outcomes.\n' +
      'PATIENT SUMMARY: This study highlights the increasing integration of advanced technologies such as three-dimensional models and augmented reality in urological surgery, and emphasizes the growing demand for proper training to maximize their potential. While demonstration of their direct impact on surgical precision and outcomes would require a different study design, this analysis primarily underscores the need to establish comprehensive training programs to ensure safer and more effective care for patients.',

    title: 'Safeguarding athletes and anti-doping: applying theories of vulnerability.',
    abstract: "'Safeguarding' in sport has been a fast-growing movement, particularly in the past decade, which currently encompasses a field of study and a policy development strategy. Although it is greatly needed in all sectors of sport, the concept and application of safeguarding to anti-doping has been underexplored and under theorized. In this article, utilizing the method of critical philosophical and ethical analysis, we attempt to provide evidence regarding why the intersection between safeguarding and anti-doping is very important and requires critical analysis; moreover, we suggest that feminist bioethics reflections on vulnerability can offer unique insights into key issues related to safeguarding in sport, such as the autonomy of athletes and the concept of 'protected persons' and, most pertinent to this research, to the concepts of athlete vulnerability and anti-doping in sport. We explore the concept of vulnerability within the context of doping and anti-doping. We examine the etymology of vulnerability, discuss contemporary theories, particularly those based on biomedical ethics and feminist theories, and apply these ideas to context of anti-doping in sport. We also address the concept of safeguarding in sport, focusing on its current definitions and applications and identify gaps in the literature where doping is not yet considered a safeguarding issue. Through discussion, we link the concept of vulnerability with safeguarding by analyzing specific anti-doping cases where athlete vulnerability can, and has, resulted in significant harm to athletes' integrity and wellbeing. These cases are from situations with minors, and they serve as a platform to put forward an integrated approach for policy development that draws on feminist theories of vulnerability, safeguarding, and biomedical ethics principles. In the results presented in the summary and conclusions, we discuss how insights from feminist theories and biomedical ethics can contribute to more effective safeguarding policies, emphasizing the importance of prevention and education rather than just the current kind of safeguarding measures that are predominantly punitive. We conclude by advocating for the urgent implementation of comprehensive safeguarding measures that address the vulnerabilities associated with anti-doping amongst athletes at all levels. This approach should prioritize prevention, fostering a balanced system that emphasizes education and awareness; where education is not just solely related to individual agency and educating athletes, but also about educating all of the anti-doping movement stakeholders to understand the particular role they play in the circumstances that increase vulnerability so that the risks can be mitigated structurally as well. To achieve this end, it is essential to develop educational programs that not only inform athletes about the risks and consequences of doping, but also empowers them with knowledge about their rights and responsibilities within the sporting community and the responsibilities of other stakeholders within the anti-doing movement. These safeguarding programs should be designed not only to promote resilience against external pressures, but, in particular, to reduce vulnerability that is created structurally more broadly speaking in the anti-doping context.",

    title: 'Analysis of Birth Growth: Using a Mixture Cure Frailty Model.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The birth rate is important in population growth. Concerns are growing over declining birth rates in Iran, as a developing country in the past decade. The present study aimed to examine population growth in Hamadan and the factors influencing the birth rate.\n' +
      'METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from 633 families with their first child in 2012 in Hamadan-information updated in 2022. The Kaplan-Meier plateau indicates a curing pattern; therefore, a mixture cure frailty model was employed to estimate the probability and hazard rate of having different numbers of children. This model comprises 2 components: the first estimates the probability of birth (or nonbirth, indicating cure), while the second component calculates the birth hazard rate for having different number of children.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Mothers with high school diploma (odds ratio [OR], 0.049;  = 0.004) and under diploma (OR, 0.449;  < 0.001) education levels and fathers with under diploma (OR, 0.802;  = 0.021) education levels were linked to a lower risk of birth and a higher chance of a cure. Moreover, high school diploma (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.668;  < 0.001) and under diploma (HR = 0.821;  < 0.001) education levels in mothers significantly decreased the birth hazard rate. The shape parameter in the hazard function (μ = 0.933; SE = 0.049) indicates that the hazard rate of birth was decreasing during the follow-up time.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: The study found that the mixture cure frailty model was effective in analyzing birth rates, with couples showing a decreased inclination to have more than 2 children. One contributing factor to this trend is the mothers' education and employment.",

    title: 'Performance of ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 in Solving Questions Based on Core Concepts in Cardiovascular Physiology.',
    abstract: "Background Medical students often struggle to apply previously learned concepts to new situations, such as cardiovascular physiology. ChatGPT, an AI chatbot trained through deep learning, can analyze basic problems and produce human-like language in various subjects. Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are given to students by many medical schools before exams, but due to time constraints, instructors frequently lack the resources necessary to adequately explain the practice questions. Even when given, the explanations might not give students sufficient information to grasp the concepts completely. This study aimed to examine ChatGPT's ability to solve various reasoning problems based on the core concepts of cardiovascular physiology. Materials and methods Multiple-choice questions were presented manually to both chatbots (ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5), and the answers generated were compared with the faculty-led answer key using various statistical tests. Results The accuracy rates of ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 were 83.33% and 60%, respectively, which were statistically significant. Compared to ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4's explanation of the response was substantially more appropriate. The execution of ChatGPT-4 was better than ChatGPT-3.5 in certain core concept areas like mass balance (75% vs. 50%), scientific reasoning (60% vs. 40%), and homeostasis (100% vs. 66.67%). Conclusion When it came to responding to concept-based questions about cardiovascular physiology, ChatGPT-4 outperformed ChatGPT-3.5. However, to ensure accuracy, faculty members should review the generated explanations, and thus, the growing application of generative AI in the form of virtual-assisted learning approaches in medical education needs to be carefully considered.",

    title: 'The Burden of Dental Infections Among Hospitalized Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the National Inpatient Sample Database.',
    abstract: "Background Oral infections such as cellulitis and abscesses of the oral cavity present significant public health burdens, particularly when they result in hospitalization. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune condition that presents with chronic inflammation and has been linked to poor oral health outcomes. The immunological pathway that RA shares with periodontal diseases explains its impact on oral health outcomes. This study investigates the association between RA and oral infection-related hospitalizations among U.S. adults, utilizing data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2016 to 2022. Methods A cross-sectional, retrospective analysis was conducted on 14,975,196 adult inpatient records. This sample size was derived after filtering the total number of hospitalizations between 2016 and 2022 in the NIS dataset to include only adults (>18 years) with complete data for all the variables used in this analysis. The outcome variable was hospitalization for cellulitis or abscess of the mouth (CELL), identified using ICD-10-CM codes. The primary predictor was a diagnosis of RA. Covariates included age group, sex, race, length of hospital stays (LOS), smoking status (SMK), and the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Descriptive statistics, bivariate chi-square tests, and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess associations. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Results Descriptive analysis indicated that only 10,710 (0.07%) of the total sample experienced oral infection-related hospitalizations. RA was present in 281,142 (1.88%) of patients. In bivariate analysis, RA was not significantly associated with CELL (p = 0.4306). However, when looking at multiple factors together, it was found that patients with RA were 40% more likely to be hospitalized for oral infections compared to those without RA. Other significant predictors included male sex (OR = 1.79), Black race (OR = 1.23), smoking (OR = 1.33), and longer LOS (OR = 1.44). Age was inversely related to oral infection risk, with patients aged 65 and older showing a 75% lower risk (OR = 0.25) compared to the 18-34-year-old reference group. Conclusion We found an independent link between RA and a higher likelihood of hospitalization for dental infections. This finding brings to light just how complex oral health disparities are driven not just by inflammation but also by factors like age, race, and health behaviors. These findings make a strong case for incorporating dental assessments into the routine care of RA patients and speak to the importance of focused prevention efforts. Future longitudinal research is recommended to establish causal relationships and to see how much of a difference approaches to collaborative care can make in cutting down hospitalizations related to oral infections.",

    title: 'Volcanic eruptions and the global subsea telecommunications network.',
    abstract: "UNLABELLED: When the first transoceanic telegraph cables were laid in the mid-1800s, rapid communication between continents became possible. The advent of fibre-optic submarine cables in the 1990s catalyzed a global digital revolution. Today, a network of > 1.7 million kilometres of fibre-optic cables crosses the oceans, carrying more than 99% of all digital data traffic worldwide and trillions of dollars in financial transactions. These arteries of the global internet underpin many aspects of our daily lives, and are particularly important for remote island communities that rely on submarine cables for telemedicine, e-commerce, and online education. However, these same remote communities are often in seismically and volcanically active regions and can be prone to natural hazards that threaten their critical subsea communication infrastructure. This vulnerability was acutely exposed in January 2022, when the collapse of the eruption plume of Hunga Volcano triggered fast-moving density currents that damaged Tonga's only international submarine cable, cutting off an entire nation from global communications in the midst of a volcanic crisis. Here, we present a new comprehensive analysis of damage to subsea communications cables by volcanic events from around the world, and document their diverse impacts. Examples include (i) severing of the telegraph cable crossing the Sunda Strait by a tsunami triggered by the 1883 Krakatau eruption, Indonesia; (ii) ocean-entering pyroclastic density currents, lahars, and landslides during the 1902 eruptions of Mount Pelée, Martinique, that damaged six telegraph cables; (iii) destruction of a cable landing station on Montserrat by a pyroclastic density current in 1997; (iv) submarine slope failure at Kick 'em Jenny, Grenada, that damaged two fibre-optic cables; (v) complete loss of the telecommunications network due to power outages following the 2000 eruption of Miyake-jima, Japan; and (vi) disruption to subsea cables resulting from the 2021 eruption of La Soufrière, St. Vincent. We find that the causes of damage typically relate to secondary hazards that occur not only at the same time as the eruption climax, but also some time after. There does not appear to be an explosivity intensity threshold for cable-damaging events; however, the extent of damage may be related to the original volcano morphology (e.g. steep slopes), spatial location (e.g. near the coast or partially/totally submerged), the eruption size or explosivity, and/or volcanic depositional processes involved. Based on these diverse case studies, we present lessons learned for enhancing telecommunications resilience, and discuss how subsea cables themselves can be used as sensors to improve understanding and early warning of volcanic hazards, potentially filling a monitoring gap for remote island communities.\n" +

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Access to dental care can be influenced by various factors, including socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, household language, education level, insurance, and emergency situations. This study aims to assess dental care access of children of San Francisco families during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify barriers to dental care access.\n' +
      "METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilized data from the 2022 RAPID-SF Surveys conducted by the Stanford Early Childhood Center and the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The surveys, distributed across San Francisco, consisted of three baseline and three follow-up surveys. Associations between children's past-year dental visits during the pandemic and demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, language, insurance, financial status, and education were evaluated.\n" +
      'RESULTS: A total of 680 families from San Francisco responded to baseline surveys (B1: 403, B2: 242, B3: 35). Follow-up surveys were excluded from analysis due to considerable loss to follow-up. About 34% reported difficulty accessing dental care for their children during COVID-19. Lower education, low income, and non-employer-based insurance were significantly associated with fewer dental visits ( < 0.05).\n' +

The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate study quality. A random effects model was applied to calculate pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Sixteen studies, comprising 6,345 participants, were included. The pooled analysis showed that 69% of dental students had general knowledge of HPV (range: 56%-96.5%; 95% CI: 0.56-0.81), while 77% recognized its association with OPC (range: 18%-96.4%; 95% CI: 0.63-0.89). Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies ( = 646.34,  < 0.001 for HPV;  = 804.07,  < 0.001 for HPV-OPC).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Knowledge gaps among dental students may hinder prevention efforts. Standardized education in dental curricula is crucial to ensure future dentists are well-prepared to address HPV-related conditions and promote early detection in clinical practice.',
