    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'Optimization of Corporate Governance from the Perspectives of Law and Economics and Blockchain',
    summary: 'Blockchain’s spontaneous consensus mechanism, characterized by technologies of decentralization, immutability, high transparency, and codification, helps address agency costs and the formalization of shareholder meetings in traditional corporate governance. With the advancement of blockchain technology, the integration of legal rules and code rules in corporate governance has become the new norm. As per the transaction cost theory of law and economics and the Coase Theorem, blockchain has promoted changes in governance rules by markedly reducing agency costs within companies. Corporate governance will exhibit partial and gradual adjustments when blockchain technology substantially diminishes these costs but falls short of achieving the optimal state of zero transaction costs. These changes not only enhance the transparency and efficiency of corporate governance but also effectively curb the misconduct of controlling shareholders and protect the rights of minority shareholders.',

Topic modeling using BERTopic revealed that the experimental group's reflections focused more on strategy adjustment, logical reasoning, and conceptual understanding, whereas the control group's reflections were more descriptive and operational. These findings suggest that AI-supported structured feedback can enhance the quality of student reflections, increase learning engagement, and improve collaborative interactions. This study demonstrates the practical value and effectiveness of AI-assisted reflection within the 6E+R instructional model, offering new directions for reflective design in STEM collaborative learning and expanding the potential of generative AI in educational settings.",

    title: 'Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Integration in Regional Sports Education to Foster Equitable and Sustainable Development',
    summary: 'Objective: Regional disparities in sports education have become a critical issue in the education sector. Variances in sports education resources, educational levels, and participation exist among different regions, leading to disparities in students’ physical fitness, health conditions, and developmental opportunities. Method: This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to improve equity in regional sports education through literature review, expert interviews, and data analysis. Conclusion: The causes of this phenomenon primarily involve various factors such as differences in economic development levels, urban-rural disparities, regional differences, and ethnic disparities. Measures to address this issue include raising public awareness and demand for artificial intelligence technology, developing suitable solutions, enhancing teacher training, and establishing demonstration points and cooperative schools. The application of artificial intelligence technology in regional sports education involves balancing benefits and risks, including risks related to data privacy and security, technological reliability and effectiveness, education and teaching quality, regional and cultural differences, as well as legal and ethical risks. Recommendations: It is recommended to strengthen data privacy protection, improve technological reliability, emphasize teacher guidance and supervision, and establish clear legal and ethical guidelines when promoting the application of artificial intelligence technology in regional sports education. Additionally, diversification in development pathways should be established, encouraging participation and support from various sectors of society to collectively promote the reasonable application and development of artificial intelligence technology.',

    title: 'Non-Immersive Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) with XR Elements in Nursing Education: Learning Interaction and Clinical Competence',
    summary: 'The way nursing students acquire clinical competence and patient safety awareness has changed as a result of the adoption of virtual learning environments (VLEs) in healthcare education. Non-immersive VLEs that display virtual scenarios offer secure learning experiences. Easily accessible and reasonably priced non-immersive VLEs can safely enhance learning clinical procedures. To the best of our knowledge, there is no earlier research on non-immersive VLEs with extended reality (XR) elements in nursing education, and this research fills that gap. This study investigates nursing students’ expectations and experiences of using non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to learn interaction and clinical competence, such as infusion pump operations. It also explores the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the use of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements in this context. Fifteen first-year nursing students engaged in two non-immersive learning scenarios. The learning process was structured using a seven-phase simulation pedagogy. The data were collected using pre- and post-questionnaires; group discussions; and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings highlight the potential of non-immersive VLEs with XR elements to enhance engagement, confidence, and competence acquisition in nursing students while complementing traditional hands-on training. The study highlights the importance of blended learning strategies that integrate technical and scenario-based approaches, as well as simulation pedagogy, to optimize knowledge retention and clinical competency development. As digital technologies continue to shape healthcare education, non-immersive VLEs with XR elements are valuable in bridging the gap between theory and practice, ultimately contributing to patient safety and improved healthcare outcomes.',

    title: 'Hepatitis C virus infection in blood donors in Santa Catarina, Brazil, 2010-2020.',
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Hepatitis C is a silent disease characterised by a persistent inflammatory process in the liver. Since blood is the main route of transmission, the objective of this study was to estimate the positivity rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in blood donations from the Public Blood Network of the State of Santa Catarina and to analyse the temporal trend and spatial distribution of cases between 2010 and 2020.\n' +
      'METHODS: This historical cohort study included blood donors who tested positive for HCV and donated blood at the service between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Out of a total of 1 316 605 blood donations, 782 new samples tested positive for HCV, corresponding to an overall positivity rate of 59.4 per 100 000 donations. The majority of HCV-positive donors were adults, male, of white skin colour, married, and had at least a secondary education. Most HCV-positive cases were found in the South and Coastal Regions of Santa Catarina, although municipalities with high positivity rates were observed across all macro-regions of the state.\n' +
      'CONCLUSIONS: The HCV positivity rate in blood donations from the Public Blood Network of the State of Santa Catarina demonstrated a downward trend over time, while maintaining sociodemographic characteristics similar to those reported in other regional studies. Furthermore, although HCV cases were reported in all macro-regions, the highest positivity rates occurred in the South, Alto Vale do Itajaí, Meio Oeste, Serra Catarinense, and Grande Oeste regions.',

    title: 'Scaling up a success story: how do we achieve universal access to transcranial magnetic stimulation?',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over one billion people suffer from psychiatric and/or neurological disorders for which transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has shown efficacy. Achieving widespread TMS access will require major improvements to cost and convenience. A key figure of merit for a given TMS protocol concerns not its remission rate or tolerability, but simply its treatment time per remission (TTPR).\n' +
      'RECENT FINDINGS: Outcomes for conventional bilateral TMS protocols imply a TTPR of more than 100 h - incompatible with widespread access. However, briefer accelerated and/or theta-burst protocols may improve TTPR to less than 20 h. Personalization strategies that improve remission rates sometime improve TTPR, depending on associated cost-penalties of time or complexity. A potentially groundbreaking new strategy to improve TTPR involves pharmacological augmentation of neuroplasticity, using agents such as D-cycloserine. Plasticity-augmentation may improve TTPR by improving remission rates, and by reducing the number of required sessions. Recent literature suggests that TTPR values of under 5 h per remission may be achievable via neuroplasticity augmentation.\n' +
      'SUMMARY: The most recent plasticity-augmented TMS protocols may approach or exceed cost-parity with pharmacotherapy, in terms of reducing the prevalence of depression. With the health economics of TMS improving steadily, a pathway to universal access may be within reach.',

    title: 'Getting even: occurrence of histopathological primitive melanoma diagnoses three years after the COVID-19 lockdown.',
    abstract: "The COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 caused a significant delay in histopathological melanoma diagnoses in Rome, Italy, leading to an increase in Breslow thickness and more aggressive tumor characteristics in the following years. Although there was a partial recovery in the number of diagnoses in 2021 and 2022, melanoma thickness remained higher than pre-pandemic levels. In 2023, our analysis of primary melanoma cases from the Histopathology Registry of Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata (IDI)-IRCCS in Rome showed that Breslow thickness had finally returned to, or even improved beyond, 2019 levels - indicating a resolution of the diagnostic delay. At the same time, the proportion of ulcerated and nodular melanomas declined. These findings underscore the long-term effects of pandemic-related diagnostic disruptions and highlight the importance of maintaining continuous screening programs, even during public health crises. Ongoing public education on melanoma awareness and early detection remains crucial to preventing future delays.",

    title: 'Determinants of household food security and maternal dietary diversity in rural Gedeo zone, southern Ethiopia: results from a cross-sectional study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, food insecurity and poor dietary diversity continue to affect maternal and child health, particularly in rural regions.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: We examined the status and determinants of household food security and maternal dietary diversity in rural Gedeo zone, southern Ethiopia.\n' +
      "METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 422 households, and household food insecurity and women's dietary diversity was measured. We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression.\n" +
      "RESULTS: In this study, 65.5% of mothers (95% CI: 60.7-70.0%) and 27.9% (95% CI: 23.7-32.5%) of households had adequate dietary diversity and food security, respectively. Severe or moderate food insecurity predispose to inadequate dietary diversity, whereas, higher wealth status increased the odds of adequate dietary diversity. Maternal education increased the odds of adequate dietary diversity. Regarding household food insecurity, the size of the household having a member of 5-7 and 8-12 were 78 and 76% less likely to be food insecure among households compared to 1-4 members size [OR = 0.22 (95%CI: 0.07, 0.70)] and [OR = 0.24 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.83)] respectively. Those household having high in women's dietary diversity were 83% less likely to have to food insecure among households compared to the lowest women's dietary diversity [AOR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.31)].\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: Household wealth status, maternal education, household food security status, pregnancy status were factors affected maternal dietary diversity. Family size and dietary diversity affected household food security status. Interventions should focus on maternal literacy, empowering women on income, assuring food security to increase maternal dietary diversity.',

    title: 'The effect of conservation agriculture technologies adoption on food production and security in Northern Malawi: evidence from Mzimba district.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Adoption of conservation agriculture technologies (CATs) has emerged as a strategy to improve farm productivity and achieve food security in many parts of the world.\n' +
      'AIM: This study aimed to assess the effect of CAT adoption on food production and security.\n' +
      'METHODS: This quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted in the Vibangalala Extension Planning Area (EPA) in Mzimba district, Northern Malawi. Data was collected using structured questionnaires. The data were entered in SPSS version 27. Descriptive statistics included frequency, percentage, weighted percentage, means, standard deviations, and standard error mean. Inferential statistics included a -test and a linear regression model, with the value of  < 0.05 considered statistically significant.\n' +
      'FINDINGS: The study found that households that adopted CATs have high food production and experience food security compared to non-adopters. Adoption of CATs significantly boosts production, with adopters experiencing lower food insecurity and better dietary diversity than non-adopters.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: The study confirms that adopting conservation agricultural technologies is integral to improving agricultural production, but remains entangled in disparities related to gender, farm size, and education. Efforts should be made to ensure equity and equality in conservation agricultural technology adoption to improve food security for all.',

    title: "Exploring Greek midwives' knowledge, attitudes, and practices in perinatal smoking: A cross-sectional study.",
    abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Smoking during pregnancy remains a significant global public health concern. Midwives, as frontline healthcare providers, play a crucial role in supporting smoking cessation among pregnant women. This study aimed to explore the factors associated with the implementation of smoking practices by midwives in Greece.\n' +
      "METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey between December 2022 and December 2023 among 150 midwives working in the 1st and 2nd Health Districts of Greece, as well as in private practices. Data were collected using a self-administered, anonymized questionnaire assessing demographics, knowledge, opinions, perceptions, and smoking cessation practices. Composite scores were calculated for knowledge, opinions, perceptions, and practices. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to examine the structure of midwives' opinions and perceptions. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify independent predictors of smoking cessation practices.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Among the respondents, 78% had not received formal education on smoking cessation, although 77.3% expressed a desire for training. Only 35.3% recognized that secondhand smoke affects newborns, and 32.7% felt confident in supporting pregnant women to quit smoking. Factor analysis identified two key dimensions: midwives' contribution to smoking cessation during pregnancy, and information and help to stop smoking during pregnancy, explaining 27.7% and 16.9% of the variance, respectively. Multivariate regression revealed that both factors were independently associated with more frequent implementation of smoking cessation practices (p<0.05).\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the pivotal role of midwives in smoking cessation during pregnancy and highlights the importance of perceptions, self-efficacy, and access to information in shaping their practices. Targeted education and institutional support are essential to strengthen midwives' capacity to deliver effective smoking cessation interventions. These findings can inform policy and training programs aiming to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes by reducing tobacco use during pregnancy.",

    title: 'Developing a Longitudinal Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) Curriculum for Internal Medicine Residents.',
    abstract: 'Introduction Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly recognized as a valuable tool, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing complications. Despite these benefits, barriers such as limited faculty training, equipment access, and time constraints hinder POCUS integration into internal medicine programs. We evaluated the feasibility of a multimodal, longitudinal ultrasound curriculum designed for internal medicine residents. Methods The POCUS Training Program (PTP) was implemented in an internal medicine residency program at a quaternary care center. This longitudinal curriculum comprised self-directed online modules, faculty-led didactic and scanning sessions, and the compilation of a portfolio. Program effectiveness was assessed through pre- and post-program surveys with five-point Likert scales measuring confidence with image acquisition and interpretation. Results Among the 50 initial program enrollees for the 2021-2022 academic year, only nine completed the curriculum, with two meeting full requirements including completing the image portfolio. Post-program surveys responses (derived from 11 respondents among 96 total program participants at the end of 2023, 11% response rate) indicated significant improvements in confidence with the cardiac and volume assessments. In-person didactics and independent scanning were rated as the most effective learning modalities. Time constraints, inconsistent equipment access, and POCUS experience variability among supervising senior residents and attendings were the most commonly cited barriers. Suggestions for improvement included more supervised image reviews, patient scanning sessions, and streamlined image-saving workflows. Discussion We demonstrated that implementing a longitudinal POCUS curriculum can be challenging with low completion rates for the full program, but such a curriculum has the potential to improve confidence with POCUS exams. Addressing barriers, including equipment accessibility and faculty training, is paramount. Integrating POCUS into core residency curricula and increasing faculty development may also improve efficacy. This pilot program serves as a scaffold for future iterations.',

    title: 'Medication Adherence and Perceptions According to the Presence or Absence of a Migration Background in a Dialysis Unit (DIANA Qualitative Study).',
    abstract: "PURPOSE: Migration status has received little attention in the context of medication adherence. This qualitative study aims to consolidate the findings of the quantitative DIANA study by: 1) exploring medication management, medication knowledge and perceptions and 2) identifying whether there are differences in medication management, knowledge and perceptions between patients according to the patients' migration status.\n" +
      'PATIENTS AND METHODS: This monocentric qualitative study was part of the research protocol DIANA (). Patients were recruited at the chronic dialysis unit of the Lausanne University Hospital. In-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted; for allophone patients, an interpreter was present. Each interview was recorded and transcribed verbatim. A content analysis was performed.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Eighteen interviews were performed. Nine patients were Swiss, 3 had a residence/settlement permit, 6 were provisionally admitted/asylum seekers. Six interviews were performed with an interpreter. Core themes were: (1) treatment management (medication intake had become a habit, forgetting was rare), (2) heterogeneous treatment knowledge but highly perceived necessity, (3) reported medication disadvantages were pill burden and side effects, (4) role of the patient in the medical environment (trust in physicians but patients making decisions regarding their treatment on their own, without consulting healthcare professionals). Swiss patients engaged more in shared decision-making and were more likely to talk about side effects than migrant patients. Provisionally admitted foreign nationals/asylum seekers talked more about their gratitude to the healthcare system.\n' +
      "CONCLUSION: More studies are needed to understand how shared decision-making can be established between health professionals and patients, taking into account their migration status. To provide tailored education, it is essential to evaluate patients' health literacy and to use the teach-back method to find the best way to convey health messages. The acquisition of transcultural clinical skills by health professionals is necessary to support medication adherence.",
