    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +
      'physics education research that distinguish it from economics education\n' +
      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +
      'and illustrate how these practices can be adapted for economic education.',

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +
      'show that structural debriefing activities can be used effectively to introduce\n' +

    title: 'Molecular genetics and mid-career economic mobility',
    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +
      'large datasets including both genetic and phenotypic data. Based on these\n' +
      "datasets, polygenic scores (PGSs) summarizing an individual's genetic\n" +

      'misleading when the proxy of such accumulation is the average years of\n' +

    title: 'A physical theory of economic growth',
    summary: 'Economic growth is unpredictable unless demand is quantified. We solve this\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    title: 'Experience and education',
    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Effect of Using Simulation on Developing Students’ Character Education in Learning Economics',
    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    abstract: 'Health-related quality of life (HRQL) score – A numerical valuation of life in a given health state anchored between 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). These scores are used to adjust life years to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, a year of life lived at an HRQL of 0.7 is equivalent to 0.7 QALYs (or 0.7 years of perfect health). Medical expenditure panel survey (MEPS) – An annual survey of around 40 000 households in the United States. It includes a household component with demographic and health information of the participants. It also contains a provider component that obtains the cost of medical visits from providers. Prospective studies – The studies in which subjects are followed over time. Typically, this involves following subjects with and without putative risk factors for disease to ascertain who does and does not develop the disease. Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) – The life expectancy in perfect health. It is equal to the product of life expectancy and the age-adjusted healthrelated quality-of-life score. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – A year of life lived in perfect health. Randomized controlled trial – A form of experimental study in which subjects are randomly assigned to either a treatment condition or a control condition. Risk ratio – The ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to the probability of the event’s occurring in the unexposed group. Education and health together account for a quarter of the gross domestic product in the United States, and are perhaps the two most complex areas of domestic policy. They are also intertwined. Not only is health critical for learning, but also education appears to be a major determinant of health. This article begins with a brief overview of the research exploring whether the relationship between education and premature mortality is causal. The primary causes of death from which the less educated are more likely to die are then explored. These causes of death point to six health risk factors associated with lower educational attainment: higher levels of stress, lower social standing, social deprivation, behavioral risk factors, lower health insurance coverage rates, and suboptimal cognitive skills.',

    title: 'Teaching climate complacency: mainstream economics textbooks and the need for transformation in economics education',
    abstract: 'ABSTRACT In this paper we ask, what is mainstream economics education conveying to its students? Standard mainstream economics textbooks treat the environment as a specialist issue in addition to standard concerns and based on solutions that conform to those standard concerns. When viewed as socialisation for students this is a major problem. To illustrate the problems we set out key aspects of the standard format, and draw attention to the structure and contents from two well-known textbooks. Standard textbooks convey the impression that the ‘environmental issue’ is appropriately incorporated and exhibit two complacency-creating features. First, fundamental problems (acute global ecological breakdown, biodiversity loss, climate change crisis etc), issues and urgency cannot be adequately conveyed to students within this way of framing economics. Second, specific theory and policy solutions suggest that the problem is well in hand. We illustrate using the theory of negative externalities.',

    title: 'Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action',
    summary: 'In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—"Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures"—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at https://link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha ).',

    title: 'Virtual reality for education on infection prevention and control: the impact on medical students’ knowledge, attitudes and practices',
    summary: 'Background This study aims to analyse the impact of a newly developed infection prevention and control (IPC) Virtual Reality (VR)-module on medical students’ IPC knowledge, attitudes and practices. Additionally, the impact of the module on students’ and healthcare professionals’ (HCPs) confidence regarding IPC decision-making and their insight into consequences of IPC decisions were analysed. Methods The IPC VR-module was developed using a cyclical design process consisting of a prototype, first and final version. Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding IPC were compared between two groups of medical students. The VR-module was added to the IPC program for the VR group. After completion of the program, students of both groups were asked to complete an online questionnaire. Scores were summated for each subscale of the KAP, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare scores between groups. Student and HCP responses to VR-specific questions were dichotomized and a chi-square test was used to compare responses to different versions of the module. Results Students who completed the VR-module ( n  = 34) scored higher on IPC knowledge questions (score 8 / 10), than those who followed the regular program ( n  = 58; score 7/10; p  = 0.003). For the final version, the added value of the VR-module in the program was recognized by 95% of students and 90% of HCPs. Students and HCPs who completed the final version of the VR-module agreed more often with learning objectives of the VR-module than those who completed the first version. 100% vs. 80% for the statement on insight into consequences of choices ( p  < 0.001) and 89% vs. 73% for the statement on confidence taking IPC decisions ( p  < 0.001). Conclusions The innovative IPC VR-module positively impacted students IPC knowledge and was highly appreciated by students and HCPs. VR-specific learning objectives were achieved, especially for the final version of the VR-module, demonstrating the importance of a cyclical design process.',

    title: 'Fostering students’ motivation and self-efficacy in science, technology, engineering, and design through design thinking and making in project-based learning: a gender-perspective study in primary education',
    summary: 'This study examines the impact of integrating Design Thinking and Maker Education into project-based learning (PBL) activities on primary school students’ self-efficacy and motivation in Science, Technology, and Design. Drawing on Bandura’s social cognitive theory, the study addresses the gap in empirical research at the primary education level, particularly concerning gender disparities in STEM engagement. Over a three-year period, 12 public schools in Barcelona ( n  = 318 students in grades 4–6) participated in a five-session workshop where students created technological prototypes using tools like Scratch and Makey Makey. Pre- and post-intervention surveys measured changes in students’ self-efficacy, motivation, and prior behavior. Results revealed significant improvements in students’ self-efficacy, particularly among girls, with moderate to large effect sizes in key items related to confidence and active information-seeking. While most responses indicated high satisfaction, some challenges were noted in early phases of the design process. These findings suggest that early exposure to PBL approaches incorporating Design Thinking and Making can help foster positive attitudes toward STEM and reduce early gender disparities. The study highlights the value of inclusive, hands-on pedagogies and calls for extended interventions and further longitudinal research to assess long-term impact.',

    title: 'Enhancing palliative care through university-community partnerships: a systematic review of models, impacts, and challenges',
    summary: 'Background University-community partnerships (UCPs) represent a transformative model for integrating student experiential learning with community-based palliative care. These partnerships enhance empathy, interdisciplinary collaboration, and service delivery, while addressing gaps in end-of-life care. Aim This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of UCPs in palliative care, focusing on their impact on student learning, community outcomes, and innovative practices. Methods Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for studies published between January 2014 and March 2024. This search yielded 206 unique citations. Nine studies were included after the full-text screening. Grey literature sources (e.g., reports and web-based articles) were screened but excluded due to insufficient methodological rigor, and thematic synthesis was conducted using NVivo, with two independent reviewers performing data extraction. The Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBIS (qualitative) and RoB 2 (quantitative) tools. Results Of the 206 records screened, nine studies (eight qualitative and one quantitative) met the inclusion criteria. The identified UCP models include transactional, transformational, and community-based participatory research (CBPR), with CBPR noted for contextual adaptability. UCPs contributed to improving student empathy, interprofessional learning, and community empowerment. Barriers include limited resources, cultural mismatches, and inconsistent stakeholder alignments. Innovations, such as telehealth and virtual learning, were also observed. Conclusion UCPs have strong potential to enhance palliative care education and delivery. Scaling these models requires sustainable funding, culturally responsive approaches, and policy integration. Future research must emphasize longitudinal designs and standardized evaluation structures.',

    title: 'Developing the Spanish Physical Literacy Assessment for Children (SPLA-C): a delphi-based model for assessing physical literacy in schoolchildren aged 6–12 years',
    summary: 'There are different recognized assessments of physical literacy (PL), with the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy-2 (CAPL-2) being the most widely recognized worldwide. Owing to sociocultural differences, creating a country-specific PL assessment becomes necessary. The aims of this study are 1) to develop an assessment model of the Spanish Physical Literacy Assessment for Children (SPLA-C) for Spanish schoolchildren aged 6–12 years and 2) to identify the assessment weights for each of the SPLA-C components, specifying the optimal tools. A documentary analysis was carried out in which experts were consulted, and the Delphi method was used. Twenty-eight experts took part in the Delphi process, and 23 experts completed all the rounds of the survey. Experts’ opinions are used to develop the assessment model of the SPLA-C and to identify the assessment weights for each component. A general consensus was obtained by the committee of experts for the proposed tools (85.2%). Conclusion :The SPLA-C could be considered a suitable method for assessing PL in Spanish children and adolescents and could be adapted to their educational-curricular and cultural context, after future studies analyze its psychometric properties, including the feasibility, reliability, and validity of each of the proposed instruments. What is Known : • PL supports lifelong physical activity. • No culturally adapted PL assessment exists for Spanish children. What is New : • The SPLA-C is a culturally adapted model for Spanish schoolchildren. • It defines five PL components and provides consensus-based assessment tools.',

    title: 'Orchestration of corporate social responsibility in company law – reframing human security through education',
    summary: 'The objective of this paper is to argue the fundamental significance of education in addressing notable gaps in the constitutive, performance and evaluation criteria for corporate social responsibility (CSR) and endeavours to showcase the complementarity between education, human security, sustainable human development, and the pursuit of CSR as an ideal normative paradigm. An abstractive approach to studying CSR, which is common with some authors engages with corporate philanthropy, which has not been helpful outside traditional CSR paradigms without looking at key dynamics that can robustly underpin successful CSR. The paper explores the systemic nexus between sustainable development as an educational externality when embedded in CSR, climate change and action competence and how it dovetails into ‘education for sustainable development’. Methodologically, this paper doctrinally relies on the systematic analysis of written data sources to theoretically explore the central significance, and complementarity between human security, education, and human dignity and how they can orchestrate a holistic CSR paradigm. In 1994, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in formulating the human security doctrine recognised the syncretic correlation between human security, education, and sustainable human development as fundamental elements that should underpin CSR. This paper contends that these are necessary intrinsic components of human dignity as the central factor that justifies a multi-dimensional and proactive approach to CSR. Despite the criticisms against human security, this paper identifies it as an important concept that could instrumentally orchestrate a model of CSR that uniformly mainstreams sustainable human development and human dignity that leverages education which has routinely and traditionally been seen as a constitutive component of CSR. It reveals how a holistic path to CSR can reinvigorate the central pillars of human security and human dignity using education as a springboard and makes a compelling case for supporting explicit references to education in company law with appropriate human security informed constitutive, performance and evaluation criteria which are absent in existing legally orchestrated CSR.',

    title: 'Practices and challenges of implementing early childhood care and education in Bahir Dar city administration, Ethiopia',
    summary: 'Early childhood care and education (ECCE) is the basis for the enduring instillation of personal habits and societal ideals. Thus, the study aimed to investigate the practice and challenges of implementing ECCE in Bahir Dar city administration, Ethiopia. To this end, a qualitative research approach with a multiple case study design was used. Qualitative data were collected from 40 participants (ECCE teachers, caregivers, unit leaders, school principals, and Bahir Dar city administration education experts). Observation, interviewing, and focus group discussion were used as data collection instruments. As a result, ECCE was poorly implemented. By and large, the finding of this study identified many challenges that inhibit the successful implementation of ECCE, such as lack of teachers and caregivers’ training, poor physical environment, inadequate resources/facilities, inappropriate teacher–student ratio, and unrealistic demands of parents. These hindrances increase learning gaps that widen over time, contributing to higher dropout rates and reduced literacy levels. The study results would have important implications for the advancement of the ECCE program. Additionally, the findings might inform policymakers and educators on areas that require further development or intervention, ultimately contributing to improving of early childhood learning experiences.',

    title: 'Environmental Support or Just Greenwashing? Understanding the Impact of University Sustainability Programs on Students’ Eco-Behaviours in Turkey',
    summary: 'This study examines the impact of university sustainability programs on students’ eco-behaviours in Turkey, focusing on the roles of perceived institutional support, personal environmental efficacy, and the potential for greenwashing. A total of 485 students from various Turkish universities participated in a quantitative survey which were selected through purposive sampling method. The analysis, conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), confirmed several hypotheses. The findings indicate that engagement in sustainability programs positively influences students’ eco-behavioural intentions, mediated by both environmental attitudes and personal efficacy. Our findings further revealed the significant impact of perceived institutional support on students’ eco-behavioural intentions, as well as its significant moderating role in the relationship between sustainability program engagement and students’ environmental attitudes. Our study suggests that perceived greenwashing can undermine trust and engagement. The study underscores the importance of transparency, comprehensive sustainability education, and robust institutional support to foster genuine eco-friendly behaviours among students.

    title: 'Teachers and sustainability education: exploring the views of Australian preservice and inservice teachers',
    summary: 'Sustainability is crucial to the ongoing capability of Earth to sustain life. Although understood in several ways, such as climate change education , education for sustainable development and education for sustainability, international efforts have promoted sustainability as an important focus for education. In Australia, this focus is reflected in sustainability being embedded in the Australian Curriculum. Australian and international researchers have found that teachers generally understand sustainability and are favourably disposed toward it, but implementation remains an issue. This paper reports findings from an online survey administered to Australian preservice and in-service teachers. Echoing previous research with teachers, participants in this study had a positive attitude towards sustainability but lacked key knowledge and confidence to teach appropriate sustainability ideas within the Australian Curriculum. As such, the implementation of the sustainability cross-curriculum priority area seems inconsistent and there is a need to support teachers through curriculum resources, professional development, and ongoing mentoring.',

    title: 'EcoHealth as a Curriculum Aim in Science Education',
    summary: 'School science education needs to change its aims, content and pedagogies if it is to prepare students for the challenges of the Anthropocene. Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing people and other organisms. We argue for embedding EcoHealth as a curriculum aim within school science, as well as other subjects. Findings from a study undertaken in Egypt are presented, where a critical realist approach was employed, in part because of critical realism’s distinction between reality and our knowledge of reality, and in part because of its treatment of absence. A documentary analysis of the Egyptian school curriculum was conducted to examine how climate change and its health impacts are dealt with and 34 secondary students and seven teachers were interviewed across seven schools to explore their understandings of climate change and its health effects. The analysis shows stark absences in teaching and learning about climate change in Egyptian schools and little understanding or recognition of its health impacts. The findings are used to argue for a Vision III science education for climate change education in the face of environmental decline and future uncertainties. Limitations of the study include a relatively small sample size for the number of interviews undertaken, limited time to collect data due to bureaucratic delays in issuing official permissions to access schools and a paucity of existing research on this topic in Egypt. Future research could determine how the Egyptian curriculum and classroom practices are addressing the worsening climate emergency.',

    title: 'Using the hierarchy of intervention effectiveness to improve the quality of recommendations developed during critical patient safety incident reviews.',
    abstract: 'Our Canadian multi-site academic health sciences centre uses a standardized process to review critical patient safety incidents and develop recommendations to prevent incident reoccurrence. We recognized an opportunity to enhance recommendation development by integrating the Hierarchy of Intervention Effectiveness (HIE), a human factors framework, into the incident review process. This project aimed to increase the proportion of system-focused recommendations from critical incident reviews from 16 to 30% over 16 months. A multi-intervention strategy included (1) standardizing the incident analysis review template; (2) earmarking time for recommendation development during reviews; (3) providing participants with just-in-time education and tools; and (4) initiating HIE-based recommendation classification during incident reviews. Statistical process control p-Chart analysis showed an increase in system-focused recommendations from 16 to 30% over 16 months. The HIE promotes system-level change to prevent critical incidents, which other organizations may benefit from incorporating in their patient safety reviews.',

    title: '"Modeling the Behaviors and the Interactions That We Value": Critical Care Attending Physician Perspectives on Interprofessional Teaching in Graduate Medical Education.',
    abstract: ' Interprofessional teaching (IPT) has the potential to promote teamwork and collaborative patient care, but few studies have explored physician attitudes about the role of nonphysician clinical teachers in graduate medical education.  This study aimed to elucidate critical care attending physician perspectives about the role of nurses, pharmacists, and respiratory therapists in teaching medical residents.  Using a concurrent mixed methods approach, surveys and focus groups were administered to attendings in an urban tertiary academic medical center. Survey data were analyzed with descriptive statistics; focus group data were analyzed using the Framework method of content analysis.  Of attendings surveyed, 23/26 (88%) responded. Attendings reported positive attitudes about IPT; highly cited benefits included capitalizing on the unique expertise held by interprofessional providers (21/22, 95%), modeling respectful interprofessional relationships (21/22, 95%), and promoting collaborative patient care (20/22, 91%). Ten attendings participated in focus groups. Qualitative analysis revealed four major themes: overall low rates of IPT that vary by profession, potential role of attending as facilitator of IPT, multiple interpersonal and environmental characteristics that influence IPT, and impacts of IPT on education, patient care, and teamwork.  Study results suggest that attending physicians are enthusiastic about the concept of IPT and their potential role in its promotion.',

    title: 'The Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality in Dental Education: Current Applications and Future Potential.',
    abstract: 'The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) in dental education is transforming how students acquire and refine clinical skills. This article explores current applications and the future potential of AI and AR in dental training. AI, defined as the simulation of human cognitive functions by machines, enhances diagnostics, treatment planning, patient management, and educational tools through subfields like machine learning, artificial neural networks, computational vision, robotics, and speech processing. These technologies enable personalized learning, can improve diagnostic accuracy, and streamline administrative tasks. AR, which overlays digital information onto real-world components, provides immersive and interactive learning experiences. In dental education, AR-based simulations enable risk-free environments for skill development, allowing students to practice procedures on virtual patients with real-time feedback. Applications of AR include simulation and training, patient education, endodontics, implantology, and local anesthetic training. These tools help enhance spatial understanding, reduce learning curves, and facilitate standardized training across institutions. Despite challenges such as high implementation costs and the need for faculty training, the potential benefits of AI and AR in dental education are significant. As these technologies continue to evolve, they promise to transform dental curricula, improve educational outcomes, and, ultimately, enhance patient care.',

    title: 'Training Toward Health Justice: A Review of Community-Engaged Training in Primary Care Residency Programs in the United States.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: A community-engaged approach to medicine, particularly primary care, is effective for health promotion. There is, however, limited evidence and no consensus on best training practices to ensure that physicians are trained adequately to practice community-engaged medicine. To define and determine how to fill this gap, the authors conducted a systematic review of literature on community-engaged activities in primary care resident training programs. The study sought to evaluate the quality of studied interventions and assess future research needs.\n' +
      'METHOD: For this systematic review, the study team searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO using key search terms related to graduate medical education, community engagement activities, and potential outcomes. The team selected and reviewed all English-language articles published through December 2024 that described interventions in which primary care residents participated in activities that occurred in community-based settings. The team analyzed studies with quantitative and qualitative results. They assessed study quality using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI) and assessed the quality of the community-engaged educational activity using a novel instrument called the Medical Education Engagement Quality Index (MEEQI).\n' +
      'RESULTS: The study team identified and reviewed the full texts of 29 articles (10 quantitative, 10 qualitative, and 9 quantitative and qualitative articles). Interventions included community engagement activities with varied settings, study length, and learning objectives. Outcomes included a change in attitudes, knowledge, skills, and career choices. The mean MERSQI score was 9.0 (range, 5.5-11.5), and the mean MEEQI score was 6.2 (range, 4.0-10.0).\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings revealed limited quality and substantial variability of the current literature. Future research should use more rigorous evaluation methods to determine which community-engaged curricular components can most effectively provide primary care resident physicians with the skills needed to provide high-quality primary care, particularly for vulnerable populations.",

    title: 'Preparing Medical Students and Physicians to Cope With Their Medical Errors: A Scoping Review.',
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Many clinicians will experience feeling responsible for inadvertently harming a patient through medical error. These situations can be distressing, difficult to navigate, and career altering. In addition to aftermath support, there is a recognized need for preemptive education to better prepare clinicians to cope after such events. Little published guidance exists about how best to do this. This scoping review explores the current knowledge about educational programs and strategies to prepare medical students and physicians to cope effectively with their own medical errors.\n' +
      'METHOD: Three online databases, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus, were searched on January 3, 2025, for articles published from database inception to the search date that described programs designed to prepare medical students and/or physicians to cope better with personal involvement in patient harm from medical error. Eligibility screening and data recording were independently performed by 2 reviewers. Simple data were summarized and common pedagogical strategies were identified by inductive thematic analysis.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The search yielded 5,359 unique articles for screening, of which 97 full-text articles were retrieved. Twelve articles met the eligibility criteria. The study interventions vary in structure and delivery methods but share similar rationale, key messages, and pedagogical strategies. Dominant pedagogical strategies were divided into 2 groups: (1) what students need to learn about coping after medical error (attend to emotions, universality of fallibility, helpful and unhelpful paths for coping, workplace culture, care for colleagues, transferal of learning to the workplace) and (2) ways to support students in this learning (actual cases, psychological safety and honest conversation, role-modeling, reflection and learning from others' experience).\n" +
      "CONCLUSIONS: A constellation of pedagogical strategies synthesized from the literature provides program design ideas for education that targets the development of learners' capacity to cope with involvement in patient harm from medical error.",

    title: 'An Asynchronous Online Course to Introduce Interprofessional Education to Incoming Health Professions Students.',
    abstract: 'PROBLEM: Interprofessional practice and education (IPE) (educators and learners from ≥2 health professions) can improve patient health outcomes and is required for most health professional program accreditation. Conflicting academic schedules and space limitations are obstacles to implementing interprofessional learning experiences that prepare future clinicians for team-based care.\n' +
      'APPROACH: In February 2019, an asynchronous online course (eCUIMC) was created at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) to equip incoming health professions students to deliver team-based health care and engage in IPE without a shared space and time. eCUIMC oriented first-year students to the IPE core competencies: (1) values and ethics for interprofessional practice, (2) roles and responsibilities, (3) interprofessional communication, and (4) teams and teamwork. Participants were assigned to interprofessional teams of 8 students and 2 faculty. During a 5-day period in fall 2019 and 2020, participants completed interactive activities, performed a clinical case study, facilitated discussions, and completed a self-directed learning activity addressing structural determinants of health. Students completed a pre-post survey of beliefs and attitudes using the 21-item Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale, which uses a 7-point scale to assess the change in interprofessional socialization after interprofessional education, with 1 indicating not at all and 7 indicating to a very great extent.\n' +
      'OUTCOMES: A total of 1,345 participants, representing 10 different health professional programs, completed course evaluations and a pre-post survey of attitudes. Most students found the course engaging, relevant, and manageable, with 1,267 (94%) reporting increased understanding of other health professions. Mean Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale scores increased from 4.5 to 5.8 (P < .001).\n' +
      'NEXT STEPS: eCUIMC is a feasible and effective modality for uniting students from different health profession programs where time and space are barriers. eCUIMC is being integrated into the curriculum as an annual requirement for all 10 CUIMC health professions programs.',

    title: "Macy Foundation Innovation Report Part II: From Hype to Reality: Innovators' Visions for Navigating AI Integration Challenges in Medical Education.",
    abstract: 'PURPOSE: Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to significantly impact medical education, yet its implementation raises important questions about educational effectiveness, ethical use, and equity. In the second part of a 2-part innovation report, which was commissioned by the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation to inform discussions at a conference on AI in medical education, the authors explore the perspectives of innovators actively integrating AI into medical education, examining their perceptions regarding the impacts, opportunities, challenges, and strategies for successful AI adoption and risk mitigation.\n' +
      "METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 medical education AI innovators-including learners, educators, institutional leaders, and industry representatives-from June to August 2024. Interviews explored participants' perceptions of AI's influence on medical education, challenges to integration, and strategies for mitigating challenges. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify themes and synthesize participants' recommendations for AI integration.\n" +
      "RESULTS: Innovators' responses were synthesized into 2 main thematic areas: (1) AI's impact on teaching, learning, and assessment, and (2) perceived threats and strategies for mitigating them. Participants identified AI's potential to enact precision education through virtual tutors and standardized patients, support active learning formats, enable centralized teaching, and facilitate cognitive offloading. AI-enhanced assessments could automate grading, predict learner trajectories, and integrate performance data from clinical interactions. Yet, innovators expressed concerns over threats to transparency and validity, potential propagation of biases, risks of over-reliance and deskilling, and institutional disparities. Proposed mitigation strategies emphasized validating AI outputs, establishing foundational competencies, fostering collaboration and open-source sharing, enhancing AI literacy, and maintaining robust ethical standards.\n" +
      'CONCLUSIONS: AI innovators in medical education envision transformative opportunities for individualized learning and precision education, balanced against critical threats. Realizing these benefits requires proactive, collaborative efforts to establish rigorous validation frameworks; uphold foundational medical competencies; and prioritize ethical, equitable AI integration.',

      'DESIGN: A representative population-based prospective cohort study of adolescent girls and young women (AGYW).\n' +
      'METHODS: Between 2017 and 2019 we interviewed a random sample of AGYW (13-30 years) annually and collected dried blood spot samples for HIV and HSV-2 serology. YWSS were defined as engaging in transactional sex and/or sex work in the past 12 months. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between selling sex and incident HIV or HSV-2 infections, using inverse probability weighting to adjust for potential confounding (age, education, rural/urban locality, socioeconomic status, food insecurity, and pregnancy status).\n' +
      'RESULTS: Among eligible AGYW (n = 3846), 89.2% provided responses for at least one follow-up time-point, of whom 17% reported selling sex in the past 12 months. HIV and HSV-2 prevalence at enrolment were 21% and 37.9% respectively and higher among YWSS at 42% and 69% respectively. HIV incidence was 3.4/100 person years(py) (95%CI: 2.6-4.2) higher among YWSS than others (8.2 vs 2.7/100py; Hazard Ratio [HR]: 2.70; 95%CI: 1.83-3.99). HSV-2 incidence was 18.4/100py (95%CI: 16.5-20.5), and was higher among YWSS than others (29.3 vs 17.2 100py; HR: 1.83; 95%CI 1.41-2.39). HSV-2 at baseline was associated with subsequent HIV infection (HR: 6.32; 95%CI 3.86-10.47, p<0.001).\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: HIV and HSV-2 incidence was higher among AGYW selling sex compared those who did not sell sex. These findings highlight the need for PrEP and socio-economic support for this priority population of AGYW in rural settings.',

    title: 'Predictors of metabolic syndrome among teachers in under-resourced schools in South Africa: Baseline findings from the KaziHealth workplace health intervention.',
    abstract: "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for most of global deaths, with rising prevalence in low-and middle-income countries. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of interrelated NCD risk factors, including obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and hyperglycaemia, that amplify NCD risk. Four leading modifiable factors driving NCDs are physical inactivity, tobacco and alcohol use, and an unhealthy diet. Teachers in under-resourced schools face significant health challenges, with their wellbeing often overlooked in South Africa. The prevalence and severity of MetS, adherence to physical activity guidelines, and associations with modifiable NCD risk factors were assessed. This study, part of the 'KaziBantu: Healthy Schools for Healthy Communities' project, included 168 teachers (aged 21-72, mean = 47 years) from 8 under-resourced schools in Gqeberha, South Africa. Data collection included MetS markers, device-measured physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use, and total fat, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium intake. Covariates included age, sex, race, education, and household income. MetS was observed in 58% of participants, with central obesity (79%) being the most prevalent component, followed by hypertension (59%). The largest proportion of participants (26%) had 3 MetS components, followed by 4 components (20%), while 12% had all 5 components. Nearly half (44%) of teachers were physically inactive and 53% exceeded total fat intake recommendations. Bayesian multilevel logistic regression revealed key predictors of MetS: age (per year increase; odds ratio[OR]=1.15, 95% credible interval[CrI] [1.07, 1.24]) and high daily total fat intake (OR=3.37, 95%CrI [1.03, 11.96]) were positively associated, while hours spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per week (OR=0.73, 95%CrI [0.55, 0.95]) and higher monthly household income (OR=0.14, 95%CrI [0.02, 0.72]) were protective. Addressing physical inactivity and unhealthy diets through tailored interventions is crucial to reducing MetS prevalence and improving the health of teachers working in low-resourced settings. Effective solutions should empower healthier lifestyles while tackling structural barriers to health equity.",
