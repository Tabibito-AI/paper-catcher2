    title: 'Big data in economics',
    summary: 'The term of big data was used since 1990s, but it became very popular around\n' +
      '2012. A recent definition of this term says that big data are information\n' +
      'assets characterized by high volume, velocity, variety and veracity that need\n' +
      'special analytical methods and software technologies to extract value form\n' +
      'them. While big data was used at the beginning mostly in information technology\n' +
      'field, now it can be found in every area of activity: in governmental\n' +
      'decision-making processes, manufacturing, education, healthcare, economics,\n' +
      'engineering, natural sciences, sociology. The rise of Internet, mobile phones,\n' +
      'social media networks, different types of sensors or satellites provide\n' +
      'enormous quantities of data that can have profound effects on economic\n' +
      'research. The data revolution that we are facing transformed the way we measure\n' +
      'the human behavior and economic activities. Unemployment, consumer price index,\n' +
      'population mobility, financial transactions are only few examples of economic\n' +
      'phenomena that can be analyzed using big data sources. In this paper we will\n' +
      'start with a taxonomy of big data sources and show how these new data sources\n' +
      'can be used in empirical analyses and to build economic indicators very fast\n' +
      'and with reduced costs.',

    title: 'Learning from Physics Education Research: Lessons for Economics\n' +
      '  Education',
    summary: 'We believe that economists have much to learn from educational research\n' +
      'practices and related pedagogical innovations in other disciplines, in\n' +
      'particular physics education. In this paper we identify three key features of\n' +

      'research - (1) the intentional grounding of physics education research in\n' +
      'learning science principles, (2) a shared conceptual research framework focused\n' +
      'on how students learn physics concepts, and (3) a cumulative process of\n' +
      'knowledge-building in the discipline - and describe their influence on new\n' +
      'teaching pedagogies, instructional activities, and curricular design in physics\n' +
      'education. In addition, we highlight four specific examples of successful\n' +
      'pedagogical innovations drawn from physics education - context-rich problems,\n' +
      'concept tests, just-in-time teaching, and interactive lecture demonstrations -\n' +

    title: 'Enhancing Economic Literacy through Causal Diagrams',
    summary: 'A literacy-targeted approach to economic instruction draws on insights from\n' +
      'cognitive science. It highlights that students process complex economic\n' +

      'activities centered around causal diagrams that promote a deeper understanding\n' +
      'of economic topics beyond the traditional lecture-based methods. Our results\n' +

    summary: 'Reductions in the cost of genetic sequencing have enabled the construction of\n' +

    title: 'Economics or Education: The Establishment of American Land-Grant Universities',
    abstract: `In the United States, institutions of public higher education exist in an environment characterized by constrained resources and shifting interests on the part of students and other clienteles. Parents and politicians are demanding that public universities move away from their emphasis on research and make teaching top priority. Taking the brunt of this outcry are the flagships of American public higher education: land-grant universities. Contemporary demands for change have led policymakers to reexamine the basic mission of these institutions. However, as with many areas of public policy, higher education policymakers tend to overlook historical factors in their deliberations. This is due, in part, to the time constraints of the policy-making process. There is often little time to examine historical origins of contemporary problems. In addition, policy decisions are usually based on input from analysts who are trained as economists or political scientists, or in areas such as operations research or system analysis. These approaches do not customarily incorporate historical analysis. When policymakers do request historical background or explanation, the time pressures force a rapid examination of secondary sources to produce the desired report. The authors of four widely acknowledged works on the history of the land-grant college movement--Edward D. Eddy's Colleges for Our Land and Time: The Land-Grant idea in American Education (1957); Joseph B. Edmond's The Magnificent Charter: The Origin and Role of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges and Universities (1978); Allan Nevins' The State Universities and Democracy (1962); and Earle D. Ross's Democracy's College: The Land-Grant College in the Formative Stage (1942) -- seem to consider the land-grant college movement as part of the educational evolution of the United States. They view the emergence of these colleges as inevitable because of the educational demands of a growing democracy. For instance, they suggest that the common people, particularly farmers, wanted to have available higher education geared toward their practical interests. These historians identify educational reform as the principle motivation in the passage of the Morrill Act [7, 8, 16, 18].(1) An examination of well-known histories of American higher education such as John S. Brubacher and Willis Rudy's Higher Education in Transition: An American History, 1736-1956 (1958); Richard M. Hofstadler and Wilson Smith's American Higher Education: A Documentary History (1961); Frederick Rudolph's The American College and University: A History (1962); and Laurence R. Veysey's The Emergence of the American University (1965) confirms this focus on education. These historians identify two other critical elements in the development of land-grant universities: the debate over curricular changes away from a classical toward a more science-based curriculum and the emergence of the Morrill Act (1862) as a mechanism for distributing the public lands that initiated the federal practice of grants-in-aid to achieve specific objectives [4, 12, 19, 28]. While these historians agree that educational reform was paramount, they also argue that the Morrill Act was a watermark for federal involvement in higher education.(2) This view is shared by others who have reexamined the conventional interpretation. While Eldon L. Johnson cautions against ascribing too much too early to the institutions that came out of the Morrill Act, he underscores in "Misconceptions about the Early Land-Grant Colleges" (1981) the importance of these institutions as a forerunner of change in American higher education [13]. Lawrence A. Cremin, in American Education: The National Experience, 1783-1876 (1980), takes this interpretation further by arguing that the Morrill Act established a "national network of educational research and development institutions that the federal government would subsequently use for a variety of enterprises" [5, p. …`,

    title: 'Handbook of THE ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION',
    abstract: 'A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized con-trol experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.',

    title: 'The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education',
    abstract: `A new edition of a book that details the system of transformation underlying the 14 Points for Management presented in Deming's Out of the Crisis. It would be better if everyone would work together as a system, with the aim for everybody to win. What we need is cooperation and transformation to a new style of management." -from The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education In this book, W. Edwards Deming details the system of transformation that underlies the 14 Points for Management presented in Out of the Crisis. The Deming System of Profound Knowledge, as it is called, consists of four parts: appreciation for a system, knowledge about variation, theory of knowledge, and psychology. Describing the prevailing management style as a prison, Deming shows applying the System of Profound Knowledge increases productivity, quality, and people's joy in work and joy in learning. Another outcome is short-term and long-term success in the market. Indicative of Deming's philosophy is his advice to abolish performance reviews on the job, to look deeper than spreadsheets for opportunities, and even to rethink how we teach and manage our schools. Moreover, Deming's method enables organizations to make accurate predictions, which is a valuable tool in today's uncertain economic climate. This third edition features a new chapter (written by business consultant and Deming expert Kelly L. Allan) that explains the relevance of Deming's management method, and case studies from organizations that have adopted Deming's System of Profound Knowledge, and offers guidance on how organizations can effectively "do Deming."`,

    abstract: "Objective To learn more about Biomedical Engineering and potentially obtain a lab position at the Tan Laboratory. I finished core classes for engineering and biology I took Engineering Calculus, General Chemistry and the Introductory Biology series. I learned a bit about synthetic and metabolic pathways in Bis2A. I also took Statistics and Upper-Division Economics. My professors were focused on using Excel to compute various statistics and spreadsheet calculations in Excel because that was what professionals were doing using the knowledge we learned in class. Thus, I am quite skilled in Excel. I continued on with classes, but my more relevant classes were organic chemistry, biochemistry, linear algebra, and econometrics. In organic chemistry, I learned about synthesis, NMR, IR, and I gained an understanding of how reaction mechanisms and protecting groups. In the last course of the series, the professor focused on bio-organic chemistry, which enabled me to better understand the reactions occurring in the human body. In biochemistry, I learned about the properties of the 20 amino acids, about protein purification, and about catalysts, enzymes, and how proteins function. In econometrics and linear algebra, I learned more about data analysis and how to compute regressions and other basic data analysis. My coursework was supplemented by learning a bit about Matlab and Stata. Over 300 hours of experience and community service from High School at UCI Med Center. I was a distinguished volunteer because I was the first volunteer to receive a thank you letter in all of the volunteer department's history. At UCD Med Center, I volunteered in the SICU. I am learning more about patient interactions, patient care, as well as secretarial work like answering phones and keeping track of multiple calls at once. With the College of Biology, I am currently enrolled in the Peer-Mentorship Program, where I offer advice to a freshman mentee to ease the transition from high school to college. I learned about what it takes to be a good role model and inspiration, and I intend to continue inspiring others in my life.\\",

    title: 'ChatGPT has Aced the Test of Understanding in College Economics: Now What?',
    abstract: 'The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is a standardized test of economics knowledge performed in the United States which primarily targets principles-level understanding. We asked ChatGPT to complete the TUCE. ChatGPT ranked in the 91st percentile for Microeconomics and the 99th percentile for Macroeconomics when compared to students who take the TUCE exam at the end of their principles course. The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.',

    title: 'From Theory to Practice of Promoting Student Engagement in Business and Law-Related Disciplines: The Case of Undergraduate Economics Education',
    abstract: 'Higher education is experiencing a paradigm shift from passive learning towards active learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has further presented an opportunity for education providers to enhance teaching that includes non-campus modes. However, concerns regarding student engagement lie at the heart of the transition to active learning environments in the context of the increased demand for online education. Therefore, promoting student engagement has become an educational priority since greater student engagement translates into valued student experiences, higher academic performance, and increased retention rates. This paper semi-systematically reviews the literature on student engagement in undergraduate economics education. Close emphasis is also paid to the relationships between the direct measures of disengagement such as absenteeism on student performance in economics. The student engagement framework developed by Frederiks, Blumenfeld, and Paris (2004) is used to classify the dimensions of student engagement and the factors that influence the different dimensions of engagement. The literature reviewed is predominately occupied with behavioral aspects of engagement with little attention towards capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement. Three key recommendations are noted from the study in order for business school educators and higher education policy makers to promote student engagement in economics education. Future research on student engagement in undergraduate business education should focus more on capturing the cognitive and emotional aspects of student engagement to inform policymaking in promoting student engagement.',

    title: 'What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature',
    abstract: 'An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.',

    title: 'The Impact of Education for Sustainable Development on Romanian Economics and Business Students’ Behavior',
    abstract: 'Education for sustainable development (ESD) has presented long-lasting interest for researchers and policy makers. Despite a significant body of research, more in depth empirical studies are required for a better understanding of how sustainable development goals are applied in higher education and how sustainable behavior could be shaped via ESD. The need for this kind of research arises from, first, the scarceness of existing studies that explore economic and business higher education, and, second, the necessity to properly assess the connection between ESD principles and students’ behavior. Following this rationale, the present paper aims to provide an overview of how students’ sustainable behaviors are shaped via their perception of sustainable campus initiatives, teaching staff involvement and curricula. Statistical and econometric analysis applied on data collected via a survey on students from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (N = 1253) provides findings on the extent to which the awareness of sustainable development-specific issues acquired through education leads to sustainable behavior among students. According to the results, we argue that an increasing share of sustainable development topics combined with teaching staff involvement to raise awareness of sustainability issues are crucial to students’ sustainable behavior. However, on-campus actions are unlikely to change behavior unless they are optional rather than compulsory. Our findings ratify that, since education is one of the main drivers of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for coherence in shaping higher education according to sustainability issues.',

    abstract: 'This research aims to explain the effect in using simulation to develop students’ educated character in learning economics. The quantitative analysis uses pre-and post-test experimental design, while descriptive analysis is completed with percentage analysis and the category of the mean score. Instruments of data collection use observation rule and questionnaire by using four scale assessments start from very good/strongly agree until very bad/strongly disagree. The result of the research shows that there are different characters in education development before and after implementation simulation in learning economics. The use of simulation in learning economics has an effect on the development of student character education. The simulation in learning economics can develop the students’ character with very good category, with a total percentage that shows the number of good at 56.29% and very good at 42.71%. Through simulation, learning economics conducted is easier to develop the very important character education in students’ life. The simulation which presents the real situation in learning economics improves the students’ learning experience in economics field, so that the students can feel that real condition, especially for learning activity to do the economical activity by implementing good characters (by using good ways) and avoids the bad ways which can be harmful for others.',

    title: 'Lesson Plan Designing in the Digital Age: A Multimodal Approach with ChatGPT',
    summary: 'The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping educational practices, particularly in teacher training. This study explores the integration of Digital Multimodal Simulation (DMS) and ChatGPT in enhancing lesson planning skills among Pre-service English Language Teachers (PELTs). Using a mixed-methods approach that combines rubric-based evaluation, classroom observation, and thematic analysis, the study examines the effectiveness of AI-assisted lesson planning and its perceived benefits. Findings reveal that DMS supported by ChatGPT significantly improved PELTs’ ability to structure, personalize, and align lesson plans with pedagogical standards. While ChatGPT-generated plans demonstrated strengths in clarity and differentiation, human-designed plans showed deeper engagement and resource use. Additionally, PELTs reported increased confidence, practical skills, and reflection through real-time feedback within the simulation environment. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI integration in teacher education and highlights the complementary role of human and AI collaboration in pedagogical design.',

    title: 'Media Education as AI Education—An Experiential Approach to Integrate Generative AI in Engineering Pedagogy at University',
    summary: 'The paper looks at generative AI as an issue of media education. It is based on a university seminar held in the study programme of engineering pedagogy, a teacher training study program to graduate vocational school teachers. It presents a didactic concept of a university scenario which is a setting for learning to analyse and reflect on AI systems for writing scientific papers integrating text and other media. Since the generation of text and media formats, such as, such as virtual worlds, animations, robotic objects which constitute our digital media environments. The use of AI tools has become common and widespread, university teaching, learning and training processes are challenged. What impact do those tools have on the learning processes and what kind of tasks do they facilitate? What are the challenges and opportunities opening up and which skills are required to use these tools reasonably and creatively, in engineering pedagogy study programs? In the seminar scenario applied, the didactic concept is a practice-based and shaping-oriented research approach to learning: The students are asked to undertake a research topic and test an AI tool (such as ChatGPT or other) to pursue the scientific topic. Rather than simply prompting, a writing collaboration between student and machine is realised. How to prompt the tasks to the system, so that the machine writes scientific articles of quality related to the topic selected is just one part of the task. The seminar is understood as a research environment connecting learners and machines as collaborative partners for experiential tests, for writing texts and shaping and analysing the media such as images and graphics related to it. The teaching methodology is based on a mix of theoretical Inputs related to the concepts of intelligence and creativity, the (wrong) implications linked to it as well as the practical experimentation with AI software. AI is used as a didactic tool to support those writing processes, based on the concept of activity-oriented learning. In conclusion, the paper looks at future aspects of artificial media in learning in university settings, using AI creatively to support the learning processes.',

    title: 'Integrating Artificial Intelligence in English Language Classrooms: Enhancing English for Specific Purposes Education',
    summary: 'This case study examines artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of Martin Buber’s I-It and I-Thou interactions. Data were collected using survey methodology to assess how people perceive AI’s impact on their interactions with others and with AI systems. Individuals showed various trust and concern about AI’s involvement in education stressing potential. Based on these findings, we consider the implications for the constantly changing environment of human-AI interactions, as well as various possibilities toward developing effective and ethical links throughout a progressively AI-mediated setting. This study advances the current debate on AI’s social repercussions by offering insights into establishing a more human-focused approach to integrating AI in education in the not-too-distant future. The enthusiasm for the use of this technology has engendered a fundamental shift in classroom dynamics, altering the interactions between educators, learners and students themselves. Consequently, a transition from profound “I–Thou” relationships to more utilitarian “I–It” frameworks has transpired, eroding the capacity to nurture genuine connections amongst educators, students and peers. It provides a thorough examination of the significant consequences of Martin Buber’s I-Thou and I-It relationships for educational paradigms. Technology must be embraced in today’s education and teachers must incorporate technology into their students’ learning. From the feedback obtained from surveying 500 students, hybrid learning was preferred by 45.2% of the students with only 8.8% of students preferring purely an online learning experience. However, 46% of students still preferred traditional learning. The research found it was not the actual use of AI in education per se but how e-learning was delivered with student experience, tools for aiding time management, hyper-personalisation and the “I-thou” friendly approach taken seen as being the key to the successful incorporation of AI in education and its mass adoption by learners in the near-future.',

    title: 'AI and Pre-service Teachers: Attitudes to and the Prospect of Applying AI-Based Tools in Education',
    summary: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has seamlessly woven itself into the daily routines and scholarly pursuits of pre-service teachers, thus substantially changing their perceptions of and attitudes to the use of AI and AI-based tools in the processes of teaching and learning. While these perceptions and attitudes to AI and AI-based tools may have a positive impact on these teachers’ ability to use and utilize AI-based tools, the challenge is that this ability is but intuitive. As such, the efficiency of the use of the AI-based tools in education is affected by insufficient methodology, fragmented integration of AI-based tools in the overall curriculum, thus raising questions of sustainability and overall purpose. As research on AI and AI-based tools in pre-service training is still nascent, the objective of this paper is delve into this multifaceted challenge. The findings of this research suggests that while a vast majority of future teachers engage with AI on a daily basis, their interaction primarily involves leveraging the fundamental features of freely accessible applications. It is only a few future teachers who engage with a more advanced exploration of the potential inherent in AI and related applications.',

    title: 'Analyzing the User Experience of Virtual Pedagogy in Architecture Education',
    summary: 'This study aims to analyze the user experience of virtual pedagogy in architecture education. It seeks to gather valuable feedback and perceptions from teachers and students regarding the effectiveness, challenges, and benefits of virtual pedagogy. The study employs a quantitative research design using a survey questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions to collect both quantitative and qualitative data on the user experience, challenges, advantages, and overall satisfaction with virtual pedagogy in architecture education. The findings reveal the widespread use of tools and applications, such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, and Zoom etc., for delivering both studio-based and non-studio-based courses in the virtual learning environment. The study highlights several challenges associated with virtual pedagogy, particularly for studio-based subjects, including the lack of in-person experience crucial for effective learning, difficulties in providing hands-on training, discouragement of active learning, and inadequate access to specialized tools and software. Additionally, the findings indicate that while virtual pedagogy offers flexibility and accessibility, it faces challenges in replicating the spontaneous interactions and hands-on nature of traditional in-person design studios.',

    title: 'Associations Between Intention to Leave, Job Satisfaction, and Work Environment Among Registered Nurses: A Cross-Sectional Study in the United Arab Emirates.',
    abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between job satisfaction, work environment, and intention to leave among registered nurses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and to identify potential predictors of intention to leave.\n' +
      'METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data from registered nurses working in governmental hospitals in the UAE between October and November 2022. A convenience sampling method was used to recruit 294 participants.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Approximately 40.8% of nurses reported a high intention to leave their jobs. Significant correlations were found between the intention to leave and several factors, including education level ( = .038), years of experience ( = .033), employment status ( = .002), and nationality ( = .037). Regression analysis revealed that both the work environment and job satisfaction were significant predictors of intention to leave (β = 1.156,  = .015; β = 0.857,  = .015, respectively).\n' +
      "CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that both the work environment and job satisfaction are significant and independent predictors of nurses' intention to leave their positions in the UAE. To reduce turnover, nursing managers and healthcare leaders should prioritize strategies that enhance work conditions, support professional development, reduce burnout, and offer competitive compensation, ultimately promoting nurse retention and better patient care.",

    title: 'Exploring the impact of a daily sport uniform policy in primary schools: a qualitative study with students and teachers.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Identifying effective, scalable interventions that promote physical activity in children, is a public health priority. Implementing daily sport uniform wear (activity enabling uniforms) in schools represents one such option. This qualitative study explored the perspectives of students and teachers at primary schools (elementary schools) where a daily sport uniform policy had been implemented.\n' +
      'METHODS: We used a pragmatic, exploratory qualitative study design with data collected from participants in the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial. One-on-one interviews with teachers were conducted following a semi-structured guide and student focus groups used an activity-based structure. Thirteen students and two teachers from two schools participated in data collection between August-September 2023. The two data sets (students and teachers) were analysed inductively using Framework Analysis identifying three overarching themes.\n' +
      "RESULTS: The first two themes were synthesised from both data sets while teacher's perspectives primarily contributed to the final theme. First, daily sport uniform wear was highly accepted, due to their visual appeal, simplicity and cost-savings relative to formal uniforms. Second, daily sport uniform wear positively impacted students by enabling physical activity, enhancing wellbeing, providing comfort, and promoting equity. Third, formal uniforms were perceived as the norm, associated with tradition and societal expectation.\n" +
      'CONCLUSION: This study deepens our understanding of the potential health and wellbeing benefits a daily sport uniform policy may have and highlights barriers such as traditions persist in school settings. Policy sustainment may require considered implementation support and consulting students in uniform designs and options.',

    title: "Barriers to positive bystander behavior: understanding undergraduate physical education students' attitudes and intentional behavior in gender-based violence prevention.",
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a global issue that is reported in multiple contexts, including higher education institutes (HEI) and sports settings. Individuals whose gender identity or gender expression diverges from the dominant norms within sports or HEIs are at an increased risk of experiencing GBV. Gender-based violence is broadly defined as any form of interpersonal violence directed at individuals based on their gender identity or gender expression. Undergraduate physical education (PE) students are uniquely positioned to act as change agents in the prevention of GBV, given their connection to both education and their ambition to become professionals in the sport sector. The aim of this study is to investigate PE students' perceptions of GBV, their attitudes, and intentional bystander behavior when witnessing GBV.\n" +
      'METHODS: An explorative qualitative research design using focus groups was conducted in Spain and Belgium and involved 65 undergraduate PE students selected through convenience sampling from 5 HEIs, 41 identified as males and 24 identified as females. Data were gathered through 9 focus groups guided by a semi-structured interview guide and subsequently analyzed via Nvivo through reflective thematic analysis.\n' +
      'RESULTS: Students perceived GBV as psychological, physical, and sexual violence directed at individuals based on their sex or gender identity. Their perceptions of GBV prevention were shaped by social norms and generational differences. Key barriers to intervening in GBV situations included societal norms, a lack of competencies, and the natural stress response PE students experienced when witnessing GBV.\n' +
      'DISCUSSION: The findings of this study underscore the need to shift GBV prevention interventions from merely raising awareness and disseminating knowledge to equipping PE students with skills in stress management and self-regulation. These insights lay the groundwork for developing more effective, context-sensitive GBV prevention interventions within HEIs.',

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Health is vital for survival and societal well-being, with global goals focusing on improved access and achieving progress in public health. In Bangladesh, investigating health determinants and disparities is crucial for effective interventions.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVE: This study investigates spatial and temporal variations in the influence of socioeconomic and health-related factors on the health index at a detailed district level in Bangladesh, aiming to discern disparities in health indicators among districts. Based on 21 years of secondary data across 64 districts in Bangladesh, this research deploys four Bayesian spatial-temporal models to analyze the health index and relevant variables.\n' +
      'DESIGN AND METHODS: The study identifies the optimal model by evaluating linear, analysis of variance, and autoregressive models of orders one and two. Comparative analysis utilizing the WAIC and DIC aids model selection. The MCMC method enhances precision in determining health index determinants, providing valuable insights for policymakers and researchers.\n' +
      "RESULTS: Our findings reveal that the AR (2) model demonstrated superior performance among all the spatiotemporal models. The health index demonstrated a consistent upward trend overall, but regional variations in residents' health indices were noted. Positive spatial autocorrelation was identified in the health index, emphasizing interconnected health outcomes. Spatiotemporal models underscored the significance of the income index, child mortality, life expectancy, and the proportion of the active population as crucial factors shaping the health index in Bangladesh.\n" +

    title: 'Towards proton therapy guidelines for radiation therapists and dosimetrists: A scoping review.',
    abstract: 'With the increasing number of proton therapy centers worldwide, particularly in Europe, proton therapy is becoming a more established treatment option. However, education and guidelines, specifically tailored to radiation therapists (RTTs) and dosimetrists, are lacking. Through the "Towards a Sustainable RTT Network" (TaSeRnet) project, efforts are underway to harmonize proton therapy practices among RTTs and dosimetrists across Europe. This scoping review aims to identify and summarize existing guidelines relevant to RTTs and dosimetrists working in proton therapy, providing a necessary first step toward the future development of specific guidelines and education for these professions. Ten articles were identified that include guidelines covering certain aspects of proton therapy workflows in several clinical indications. However, significant gaps remain regarding the specific tasks performed by RTTs and dosimetrists. In particular, no guidelines were found addressing treatment execution, a workflow typically performed by RTTs. Moreover, the limited involvement of RTTs and dosimetrists in the development of existing guidelines may result in the exclusion of essential practical knowledge and expertise. As they play a critical role in the daily delivery of proton therapy, their input is vital to ensure comprehensive and applicable guidelines. In conclusion, this review underscores the need for developing guidelines specifically for RTTs and dosimetrists in collaboration with the broader multidisciplinary team. Developing such guidelines will support the standardization of clinical practice and contribute to improved quality of care.',

    title: 'Use of double PGF2a in a 7-day CIDRSynch timed artificial insemination in water buffloes during summer.',
    abstract: "Water buffaloes often experience reduced fertility during the summer due to factors like temperature, photoperiod, and nutrition. This seasonal decline in reproduction affects calf and milk production, impacting farm economics. This research focuses on creating a breeding program tailored to the summer conditions in the Philippines to improve artificial insemination (AI) conception rates and boost production. During the summer months (March-June), water buffaloes may experience decreased luteal function or persistent corpus luteum, lowering fertility. To address this, a timed AI (TAI) protocol was developed, utilizing CIDR + GnRH on Day 0, followed by CIDR removal + PGF2a on Days 7-8, and hCG injection with AI on Day 10. The summer protocol included a double PGF2a injection on Days 7 and 8, compared to the control protocol with a single PGF2a injection on Day 7. Results from the PCC Genepool farm showed a 52.63 % conception rate in 2023 with the summer protocol (10/19), compared to 27.27 % with the control (3/11). In 2024, the summer protocol alone led to a 57.14 % conception rate (20/35). Additionally, milk production per cow per day ranged from 5.16 to 5.45 liters in 2024, compared to 2.62 to 3.0 liters in 2023. The summer protocol's effectiveness in increasing AI conception rates contributed to higher milk production, supporting sustainable livestock farming year-round.",

    title: 'How effective is the implementation of the valproate pregnancy prevention programme in Montenegro? - A 7-year national retrospective study.',
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Valproate (valproic acid, sodium valproate) is authorised in Montenegro for epilepsy and bipolar disorder treatment. Due to known teratogenicity, risk minimisation measures were introduced in 2014 and further reinforced in 2018 by the implementation of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme (PPP). Despite these measures, consumption of valproate in Montenegro increased in the period 2016-2022.\n' +
      'OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of risk minimisation measures on valproate prescription in Montenegro.\n' +
      'DESIGN: A retrospective, observational, 7-year, nationwide study.\n' +
      'METHODS: The Primary Health Care Information System (PHCIS) was used as a data source. The health records of women of childbearing potential (12-55 years) for the period 2016-2022 were analysed. Additionally, unstructured data were reviewed to determine the number and characteristics of valproate-exposed pregnancies. The software PASW, version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis.\n' +
      'RESULTS: A total of 2247 women of childbearing potential using valproate were identified during the observed period. The number of patients using valproate for epilepsy treatment decreased by 24% while the use of valproate in psychiatry increased by 45% over the observed period. The age of the patient was the only predictive factor for successful PPP implementation (chi-square = 35.811, df = 4 and  < 0.001). The odds ratio (OR) for the age category was 1.22 (95% CI: 1.10-1.35). Contraception prescription was recorded in only 1.5% of patients following the PPP implementation. A total of 11 cases of exposed pregnancies were identified, while epilepsy was the indication in 5 (45%) cases.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: Regulatory risk minimisation measures had a limited impact on reducing the risk of valproate teratogenicity in Montenegro, with the most success in the group of youngest patients. Measures were more effective in the epilepsy indication. The rising use of valproate for psychiatric indications is concerning. Targeted education, better preconception care and improved coordination among healthcare professionals are necessary.',

    },
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Widening participation is an important consideration in medicine, which has been historically elitist. Despite the evolving evidence base on WP in medicine and advancing of discourse around conceptualizing WP, the identity of students from WP backgrounds remains problematized. Currently, there are few studies exploring how WP medical students have found strength in their experiences of adversity and developed skills which will be an asset to their career. To address this gap, the aim of this study is to understand, using a strengths-based approach, the strengths and resources that WP students draw on to enact success in medicine.\n' +
      "METHODS: This is a qualitative study using individual interviews for data collection. We selected the identity-specific strength lens to understand how WP students in medicine draw on their strengths and resources to enact success in pursuing careers in medicine. We recruited eligible students who had completed, or were undertaking, a 'gateway' programme and had directly entered the undergraduate medical degree and who had fulfilled university WP criteria prior to entry. Interviews were recorded electronically and transcribed verbatim. Data were coded inductively and in accordance with thematic analysis.\n" +
      'RESULTS: Five main themes were constructed from the analysis. Participants drew on the following strengths and resources to enact success in medicine: (i) Not taking no for an answer: determination and perseverance; (ii) Learning from the past: using their lived experience; (iii) Making things work: resourcefulness; (iv) Drawing on their sense of self: Self-awareness, reflection and independence; and, (v) Growing a support network: Having strong relationships with others.\n' +
      'CONCLUSION: There is still much to be done in creating inclusive environments in medical education which promote belonging and development of diverse values and beliefs. However, using strengths-based approaches can reframe study of widening participation in medicine and shift thinking and discourses from deficit to anti-deficit ways of thinking and discourses.',
