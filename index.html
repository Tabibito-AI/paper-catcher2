The shift to outpatient postoperative care, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizes the need for effective management of postoperative outcomes. The high rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in Korea necessitate focused transitional care during patient discharge periods. However, limited research exists on the postoperative experiences of discharged patients, underscoring the necessity of establishing evidence-based services to optimize transitional care.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to analyze the emotional experiences of patients who underwent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular surgeries using data from Naver, a major South Korean web portal.
METHODS: Posts were collected using specific keywords and processed with the Korean Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (KoBERT) model based on Transformer, which classified sentiments into positive, neutral, and negative categories. Model performance was validated according to precision, recall, F1-score, and support. Sentiment analysis was conducted within the Transitional Care Model (TCM) framework, divided into 5 domains: health status, care resources, care demand, interaction, and mental state.
RESULTS: The KoBERT model demonstrated high classification performance, achieving a precision of 96%, recall of 94%, and an F1-score of 94%. Sentiment analysis revealed that compared with cardiovascular surgery patients, cerebrovascular surgery patients experienced higher negative emotions regarding health status, whereas cardiovascular surgery patients expressed more negative sentiments in care demands.
CONCLUSIONS: Different patient groups experience distinct emotional and practical challenges postdischarge. Particularly, keywords within the TCM framework highlight that cerebrovascular surgery patients require robust rehabilitation and caregiver support, whereas cardiovascular surgery patients need better cost management. These findings underscore the importance of personalized transitional care strategies tailored for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The insights derived from this study can guide health care policymakers in designing more targeted and patient-centered interventions to improve postdischarge care and patient-centered transitional care, ensuring continuous and effective postoperative management."

In September 2019, leaf and stem blight was observed on A. hybridus plants growing in agricultural fields in Wanju (GPS 35°50&#39;42&quot;N, 127°16&#39;34&quot;E), Korea, with disease incidence averaging 10-20%, but ranging from 5% to 40% across different sites. Affected plants exhibited brown, irregular lesions (2 to 3 mm) on leaves and stems, leading to plant death. Small pieces (5 mm²) from the lesions of 10 affected samples were surface sterilized, plated on PDA with streptomycin sulphate (30 mg/liter), and incubated at 25°C for 5 days. After 3 days, fungal colonies were 3-4 cm in diameter, white to yellow-brown with a smooth texture, and gradually darkened to brown after 2 weeks. Conidiophores were irregularly branched, with one to five phialides. Chlamydospores were spherical, yellowish-brown in color, and measured 5.42 to 6.44 × 3.61 to 4.47 µm (n = 50) with a smooth, thick wall. Conidia were ellipsoidal to cylindrical, with truncate ends, formed chains, and measured 3.63 to 4.5 × 2.24 to 2.78 µm (n = 50), with a length/width ratio of 1.46 to 1.78. Identical fungal cultures were isolated from 7 of the 10 symptomatic plants, including two representative isolates (KACC49613, KACC410985) deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection. Based on morphological characteristics, the fungal isolates were identified as Paecilomyces formosus Urquhart (Samson et al., 2009; Sabernasab et al., 2019). For molecular identification, genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia, and PCR was performed to amplify the ITS region and beta-tubulin (TUB) gene with ITS1, ITS4, BT1A, and BT2B (White et al., 1990; Glass and Donaldson, 1995), respectively. Obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS: MW412748.1, PV436946.1; TUB: PQ659292.1, PV446603.1). A BLASTn search revealed 99.81% similarity for ITS and 99.1% for TUB to P. formosus CBS 990.73B in GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS and TUB sequences showed Korean isolate clustering with P. formosus sequences in a well-supported group, confirming its identity. Pathogenicity test was performed twice with two isolates (KACC49613 and KACC410985) separately by spraying 15 ml of a conidial suspension (2.8 × 104 conidia /ml) on 30 healthy A. hybridus plants, with five control potted plants sprayed with sterile water. All plants were kept at 80% relative humidity and 23 °C, with a 12-h photoperiod. Symptoms resembling to those observed in the field appeared after four weeks, while control plants remained asymptomatic. The pathogen was successfully re-isolated from symptomatic tissues, confirming Koch&#39;s postulates. This study is the first report of blight caused by P. formosus on A. hybridus in Korea, although this pathogen has been recorded to infect a broad range of host plants (Farr et. al. 2001). Field surveys suggest that P. formosus has potential as a biocontrol agent for managing this invasive weed. However, further studies are needed to evaluate its host range and potential risks to edible amaranths in Korea."

However, there has so far not been an instrument to measure an individual&#39;s subjective financial well-being.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt the Korean version of the Personal Financial Wellness (PFW) scale.
METHODS: The Korean version of the PFW scale was evaluated with 2,044 adults who participated in an online survey in South Korea. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the factor structure of the PFW scale. Its validity was assessed by examining factor loadings, average variances extracted (AVE), and conceptual reliability (CR). In addition, the relationships between the PFW scale and the scales measuring theoretically relevant constructs were analyzed. Reliability was examined using Cronbach&#39;s alpha coefficient, the corrected item-to-total correlation, the inter-item correlation, and McDonald&#39;s omega.
RESULTS: The evaluation of the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the PFW scale indicates that it exhibits a single-factor structure, consistent with the English version. Factor loadings, AVE, and CR all exceeded the recommended thresholds. The model also demonstrated consistent fit indices regardless of the subsample. Invariance of both configural and factor loadings was established across gender, while invariance of configural, factor loadings, and intercepts was confirmed across regions. Additionally, the PFW scale, a subjective measure of financial well-being, is more strongly related to health-related variables than monthly income, which is an objective indicator of financial well-being. Internal consistency reliability for the Korean version of the PFW scale was found to be satisfactory.
CONCLUSIONS: The adaptation of the Korean version of the PFW scale provides a valuable instrument for researchers and practitioners in South Korea, where an instrument measuring an individual&#39;s subjective financial well-being does not exist."

Between October 2022 and 2023, a leaf spot was observed on Buxus harlandii in Nanyang City, Henan province (33°3&#39;36″ N, 112°35&#39;22″ E), with an incidence rate of 62% based on assessment of 50 randomly selected plants. The initial symptoms appeared as brown spots and expanding grayish-white, desiccated lesions on the leaves. As the disease progressed, these lesions spread throughout the plant, resulting in wilting and defoliation. Diseased leaves were collected, cut into 3 × 3 mm2 pieces. The tissues were disinfected with 75% ethanol solution for 30 s, followed by 1% NaClO solution for 60 s, placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. A total of 28 purified fungal isolates were obtained from 30 samples. These fungal isolates showed similar morphological phenotypes. The three strains (QSHY8, QSHY10, and QSHY16) from different areas were selected for identification. The colonies were gray to dark green with abundant aerial mycelium on the surface. Conidia were obclavate or spheroidal, dark brown, with 2 to 3 transverse septa and 1 to 3 longitudinal septa, measuring 12.3 to 27.1 × 2.7 to 5.9 µm (n=100), with conical beak lengths ranging from 0 to 2.9 μm. Conidial chains exhibited a unbranched linear morphology, comprising 4 to 12 conidia (70.2 to 192.5 µm).These morphological characteristics were consistent with the genus Alternaria (Woudenberg et al. 2015). The rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor (tef1), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2) were amplified and submitted to GenBank with accession No. OR352571, OR352576, OR352577 (ITS), OR360378 to OR360380 (tef1), OR360381 to OR360383 (gapdh), PP054843 to PP054845 (rpb2). The isolates were identical to each other at each locus. BLASTn analysis of strain QSHY8 showed that ITS, gapdh, and rpb2 regions revealed 100% identity (503/503 bp, 557/557 bp, 951/951 bp) with Alternaria alternata strain (PV444769, MK903028, MK605900), and 99.57% identity with PV054872 (231/232 bp) for tef1. A phylogenetic tree of concatenated markers sequences (ITS, tef1, gapdh, and rpb2) and ex-type strains sequences was constructed using MEGA with the neighbor-joining method. The three strains formed a clade with the strains CBS121456 of Alternaria alternata, distinct from other Alternaria spp. Healthy potted plants were used for the pathogenicity test. Five leaves per plant were wounded at a single spot each with sterile needles to breach the cuticle. A 20 µl drop of 106 conidia ml-1 suspension was placed onto each wound, and sterile water served as blank controls. All plants were grown in pots in climate incubators maintained at 28°C and 90% relative humidity. 10 days post-inoculation, lesions consistent with those observed in the field were present on the inoculated plants, while no symptoms appeared on the mock-inoculated controls. Isolates recovered from the symptomatic plants were identified as A. alternata. based on morphological and ITS sequence analyses, fulfilling Koch&#39;s postulates. Leaf spot of boxwoods (Buxus spp.) caused by A. alternata has been reported in Korea (Shin et al. 2022). This is the first report of A. alternata causing leaf spot on B. harlandii in China. Leaf spot significantly reduces ornamental value, and this finding provides valuable insights into the control of the disease."

However, there are no nationwide outcome data demonstrating its impact. This study aimed to identify patients with haemophilia A (PwHA) and observe trends in joint-related outcomes and life-threatening haemorrhages using national claims data.
METHODS: This serial cross-sectional study analysed claims data from the Health Insurance and Review Assessment in South Korea. PwHA treated with FVIII at least twice between 2007 and 2022 were identified. We observed joint procedures, life-threatening haemorrhages and comorbidities between 2008 and 2021.
RESULTS: The number of identified PwHAs was 1193 in 2008 and 1517 in 2021. The proportion of older adult patients has increased over the past 14 years. The joint procedure rates per 1000 patients were 61.2 (95% CI 48.0‒76.9) in 2008 and 17.1 (11.2‒25.1) in 2021. The rate was highest in patients with a severe phenotype. Annually, less than 2% of patients experienced life-threatening haemorrhages, with approximately 90% of the cases attributed to central nervous system and gastrointestinal bleeding. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes increased over the years (6% in 2008 and 15% in 2021, and 6% in 2008 and 9% in 2021, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This study revealed previously unreported long-term trends in haemophilia-related outcomes and comorbidities in Korean PwHA. Although the number of older adult patients has increased, joint-related complications have decreased over time. The trends, observed over 14 years, provide valuable insights for enhancing the treatment of PwHA."

RESULTS: The GastroPanel- and L-TIA-derived sPG results showed high concordance. An sPG I concentration of 70 ng/mL and a PG I/II ratio of 3 measured with the L-TIA kit corresponded to 100 ng/mL and 5.3 with the GastroPanel kit. sPG I decreased in the GA and GC groups, whereas sPG II was lower in the GA group, but higher in the GC group than that in control group.

METHODS: The tumor board was initiated in January 2021 through a partnership between Washington University in St. Louis, USA, and nine institutions, ultimately expanding to 39 institutions across 25 countries. Monthly virtual meetings facilitated multi-disciplinary case reviews offering diagnostic and management recommendations. A retrospective analysis of 29 sessions over three years was conducted, and a cross-sectional web-based survey among participants assessed their experiences and satisfaction.
RESULTS: From January 2021 to December 2023, 101 cases were reviewed. The most diagnoses were low-grade gliomas (23.4%) and neurofibromatosis type 1 and 2 (32.7%). Newly diagnosed cases comprised 51%, while 40% involved recurrent or progressive disease, and 9% were inquiries during ongoing therapy. Recommendations predominantly addressed therapeutic strategies (60.7%). Advanced diagnostics, such as methylation profiling, refined diagnoses in several cases. The survey, with a 35% response rate, showed high satisfaction, with 91% finding the meetings educational. Barriers included time constraints (71%) and conflicting commitments (27%).
CONCLUSION: This initiative, to our knowledge, represents the largest international pediatric neuro-oncology tumor board. Multidisciplinary discussions improved diagnostic precision, informed therapeutic decision-making and facilitated educational exchange. Participants reported positive impacts on professional development and alignment with institutional needs. Despite challenges, this study highlights telemedicine&#39;s potential to bridge resource disparities and improve the outcomes globally."

However, the recovery of function for activities of daily living can be prolonged or incomplete. The reasons can be different. The aim of this work is to evaluate the causative relationship between the range of lateralization and the load distribution in movements simulating the daily life joint activities. We also collected data about the primary and final implant&#39;s lengthening and glenoid components (inclination, version, rotation and lateralization) and we compared them with load values measured during flexion-extension, internal-external rotation and during static positions: &quot;over-the-head&quot;, &quot;behind-back&quot; and &quot;cross-the-body&quot;.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 22 patients underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty implantation assisted by GPS navigation system (Exactech Inc, Gainesville, FL, USA). Preoperative data were collected by planning software. Intraoperative data were recorded using computer-assisted surgery; a wireless joint load sensor placed into the humeral trial insert was used to record joint load in real time while the RTSA was taken through passive motion.
RESULTS: Mean and the Standard Deviation of the force data for each movement and position have been evaluated. It has emerged that, preserving a final lateralisation from 18 to 22 mm, the average of force recorded, considering each movement and position, resulted between 11.8 and 22.5 lbf; the force on the glenoid&#39;s surface is influenced by the final lateralisation, the lengthening of the implant and the grade of abduction of the arm during the movement.
CONCLUSION: The data spread is consistent and narrow, especially for internal-external rotation and &quot;behind-back&quot; position. The limited number of patients did not allow the simultaneous analysis of multiple parameters and that limits our statistic results. Future trials should examine a broader range of patient-reported outcome measures and outcome variables including active range of motion kinematic data. This join load sensor could improve the understanding of how intraoperative joint load measurement may influence postoperative patient function and satisfaction. Future studies should integrate the post-operative follow-up in order to increase the knowledge about the causative relationship between intra-operative data and outcomes. This could improve the surgeon experience and his choices before and during the surgical act. This preliminary study evidenced a clear trend that can be statistically reinforced by enlarging the dataset."

                        data-abstract="BACKGROUND: To analyze the osseointegration of dental implants in irradiated patients through a bibliometric study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive and retrospective bibliometric study was conducted, focusing on English-language scientific publications indexed in Scopus from January 2018 to May 2024. To maintain quality and relevance, the study excluded abstracts, letters to the editor, book reviews, opinions, and symposium reports. The search, conducted on May 11, 2024, utilized the MeSH terms from the National Library of Medicine along with Boolean operators to refine the search. Relevant indicators such as citation count, publications by country, year, author, journal quartile, and more were examined. The data were analyzed using SciVal, Mendeley, Bibliometrix, and VOSviewer software.
RESULTS: The research identified 25 relevant papers, with an annual growth rate of 16.73%. The average number of citations per paper was 9.8, with a total of 846 references and 144 authors. German institutions led in scientific production, with the highest impact seen at Hospital Santa Catarina of Brazil. Brazilian authors showed the highest citation impact, while Heiland Max attained the highest h-index. Most publications were within the first (Q1,  = 14) and second (Q2,  = 6) quartiles, with 2021 standing out as the year with the highest impact. Collaboration maps highlighted international cooperation between several countries such as the USA, Spain, China, and Chile.
CONCLUSION: The study provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of osseointegration of dental implants in irradiated patients, highlighting key trends and collaborations in the field.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study underscores the clinical importance of osseointegration of dental implants in patients who have undergone radiation therapy. By providing insights into trends and collaborative networks, enhances our understanding of these patterns, which can improve treatment strategies, and patient outcomes, and guide future research. Ultimately, this advances the field of dental implantology for irradiated patients.

METHODS: Data were collected from 257 adults in Korea aged 18 and over (157 men and 60 women), examining their level of alcohol use disorder and the usage of digital self-care devices (such as the number of days alcohol consumption was logged, continuous days of sobriety, feeling, alcohol cravings, alcohol probability, etc.).
RESULTS: The results confirmed that the severity of alcohol use disorder significantly decreased before and after the use of digital self-care devices, as analyzed by a t-test (M = 5.239, SD = 10.121, t = 6.945, df = 179, P = .000***). Additionally, a machine learning analysis (random forest) was conducted to explore the factors that most influence the reduction in alcohol risk levels among participants. The analysis revealed that the factor &quot;continuous days of sobriety&quot; had the most significant impact on the reduction of alcohol risk levels. The predictive accuracy of this factor was demonstrated using an ROC curve (AUC = 0.724). Subsequently, a multiple regression analysis was conducted to explore the factors influencing continuous days of sobriety. The results indicated that age and the logging of sobriety days had a significant impact, with the logging of sobriety days emerging as the most influential factor.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in reducing alcohol consumption and achieving successful sobriety, it may be more important to maintain continuous sobriety rather than the total number of sober days. Additionally, it is necessary to identify the key factors that help maintain continuous sobriety. Understanding which elements need to be fulfilled through digital self-care devices to sustain continuous sobriety is also essential.

This review aims to systematically evaluate the structural optimization, mechanisms of action, and clinical applications of quercetin and its nano-derivatives in cancer treatment. Employing a bibliometric analysis of 6231 articles from the Web of Science Core Collection, we observed a notable increase in annual publications, particularly from the USA and China, indicating a growing interest in quercetin&#39;s therapeutic potential. Our findings reveal that quercetin enhances the efficacy of conventional therapies by modulating critical signaling pathways, thereby increasing cancer cell sensitivity while simultaneously protecting normal tissues from therapy-induced damage. Structural modifications, including glycosylation, methylation, sulfation, and glucuronidation, alongside nanoparticle formulation, significantly improve the stability, solubility, and bioavailability of quercetin, enabling targeted drug delivery. Despite the promising preclinical outcomes, the clinical translation of quercetin remains nascent, necessitating further rigorous research to validate its safety and efficacy in human subjects. In conclusion, while quercetin exhibits substantial anticancer properties and therapeutic potential, future studies should focus on expanding sample sizes, elucidating metabolic pathways, and conducting comprehensive clinical trials to inform its application in oncology."

Some patients may be transported by stretcher, but some will be bedbound at home. Routinely refilling all pumps at home is established practice in several parts of Europe and USA.
METHOD: Freedom of information requests were emailed to trusts and health boards hosting intrathecal drug delivery services in the UK and Ireland, asking about frequency of home visits for pump refills, how many staff travelled, use of prefilled syringes and how they would manage a patient&#39;s long-term inability to attend clinic.
RESULTS: Detailed data was received from all but 1 of 54 active clinics in the UK, but Irish legislation did not allow this data to be returned. Two thousand one hundred forty-five patients were managed with intrathecal pumps in the UK. Eleven services had less than 10 patients and 5 had more than 100. Twenty-one services did less than 1 home refill/year and 9 did more than 12/year. Twenty had travelled to patients more than 50 miles from the clinic, or to an island. Twenty-two services would send 2 clinicians and 10 would bring prefilled sterile syringes, rather than aspirate from bottles at the bedside.
CONCLUSION: FoI requests can generate a very high response rate in the UK. Many services manage a small number of patients, which would make it difficult to provide cover when a single-handed clinician is unavailable or to train a second clinician."

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to assess the prevalence, treatment, risk factors, comorbidities, and self-management behaviors of diabetes mellitus from 2019 to 2020. We also analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service to evaluate the use of antidiabetic medications in people with diabetes mellitus from 2002 through 2018. Results Among Korean adults aged 30 years or older, the estimated prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 16.7% in 2020. From 2019 through 2020, 65.8% of adults with diabetes mellitus were aware of the disease and treated with antidiabetic medications. The percentage of adults with diabetes mellitus who achieved glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;6.5% was 24.5% despite the increased use of new antidiabetic medications. We found that adults with diabetes mellitus who achieved all three goals of HbA1c &lt;6.5%, blood pressure (BP) &lt;140/85 mm Hg, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;100 mg/dL were 9.7%. The percentage of self-management behaviors was lower in men than women. Excess energy intake was observed in 16.7% of adults with diabetes mellitus. Conclusion The prevalence of diabetes mellitus among Korean adults remained high. Only 9.7% of adults with diabetes mellitus achieved all glycemic, BP, and lipid controls from 2019 to 2020. Continuous evaluation of national diabetes statistics and a national effort to increase awareness of diabetes mellitus and improve comprehensive diabetes care are needed."

Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to assess the prevalence, treatment, risk factors, comorbidities, and self-management behaviors of diabetes mellitus from 2019 to 2020. We also analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service to evaluate the use of antidiabetic medications in people with diabetes mellitus from 2002 through 2018. Results Among Korean adults aged 30 years or older, the estimated prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 16.7% in 2020. From 2019 through 2020, 65.8% of adults with diabetes mellitus were aware of the disease and treated with antidiabetic medications. The percentage of adults with diabetes mellitus who achieved glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;6.5% was 24.5% despite the increased use of new antidiabetic medications.

Materials and Methods Incidence, survival, and prevalence rates of cancer were calculated using the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, from 1999 to 2019, with survival follow-up until December 31, 2020. Deaths from cancer were assessed using causes-of-death data obtained from Statistics Korea. Results In 2019, newly diagnosed cancer cases and deaths from cancer were reported as 254,718 (age-standardized rate [ASR], 275.4 per 100,000) and 81,203 (ASR, 72.2 per 100,000), respectively. For the first time, lung cancer (n=29,960) became the most frequent cancer in Korea, excluding thyroid cancer. The overall cancer incidence rates increased by 3.3% annually from 1999 to 2012, and decreased by 5.3% annually from 2012 to 2015, thereafter, followed by nonsignificant changes. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased again from 2016 (annual percentage change, 6.2%). Cancer mortality rates have been decreasing since 2002, with more rapid decline in recent years (annual decrease of 2.7% from 2002 to 2013; 3.3% from 2013 to 2019). The 5-year relative survival between 2015 and 2019 was 70.7%, which contributed to prevalent cases reaching over 2 million in 2019. Conclusion Cancer survival rates have improved over the past decades, but the number of newly diagnosed cancers is still increasing, with some cancers showing only marginal improvement in survival outcomes. As the number of cancer survivors increases, a comprehensive cancer control strategy should be implemented in line with the changing aspects of cancer statistics."

obtained from the clinical evaluation data based on the plaque reduction
neutralization test. The constraint of the seroprevalence parameter induced
from the known confirmed coronavirus 2019 cases can be imposed naturally in the
proposed Bayesian model. We also prove that the confidence interval of the
seroprevalence parameter based on the Rao&#39;s test can be the empty set, while
the Bayesian method renders a reasonable interval estimator. As of the $30$th
of October $2020$, the $95\%$ credible interval of the estimated SARS-CoV-2
positive population does not exceed $307,448$, approximately $0.6\%$ of the

the pandemic within the United States. We find that $\sigma_\beta/\mu_\beta
\gtrsim 3.2$, where $\mu_\beta$ is the mean infectiousness and $\sigma_\beta$
its standard deviation, which implies pervasive superspreading. This result
allows us to estimate that in the early stages of the pandemic in the USA, over
81% of new cases were a result of the top 10% of most infectious individuals."

Materials and Methods As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher&#39;s exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. Results Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p &lt; 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006).

Materials and Methods The incidence, survival, and prevalence rates of cancer were evaluated using data from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database from 1999 to 2017 with follow-up until December 31, 2018. Deaths from cancer were assessed using cause-of-death data from 1983 to 2017, obtained from Statistics Korea. Crude and age-standardized rates (ASRs) for incidence, mortality, and prevalence, and 5-year relative survival rates were calculated and trend analysis was performed. Results In 2017, newly diagnosed cancer cases and deaths from cancer numbered 232,255 (ASR, 264.4 per 100,000) and 78,863 (ASR, 76.6 per 100,000), respectively. The overall cancer incidence rates increased annually by 3.5% from 1999 to 2011 and decreased by 2.7% annually thereafter. Cancer mortality rates have been decreasing since 2002, by 2.8% annually. The 5-year relative survival rate for all patients diagnosed with cancer between 2013 and 2017 was 70.4%, which contributed to a prevalence of approximately 1.87 million cases by the end of 2017. Conclusion The burden of cancer measured by incidence and mortality rates have improved in Korea, with the exception of a few particular cancers that are associated with increasing incidence or mortality rates. However, cancer prevalence is increasing rapidly, with the dramatic improvement in survival during the past several years. Comprehensive cancer control strategies and efforts should continue, based on the changes of cancer statistics."

The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing on postmortem swabs. Results A 77-year-old obese man with a history of hypertension, splenectomy, and 6 days of fever and chills died while being transported for medical care. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on postmortem nasopharyngeal and lung parenchymal swabs. Autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage and chronic inflammation and edema in the bronchial mucosa. A 42-year-old obese man with a history of myotonic dystrophy developed abdominal pain followed by fever, shortness of breath, and cough. Postmortem nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung parenchymal swabs were negative. Autopsy showed acute bronchopneumonia with evidence of aspiration. Neither autopsy revealed viral inclusions, mucus plugging in airways, eosinophils, or myocarditis. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 testing can be performed at autopsy. Autopsy findings such as diffuse alveolar damage and airway inflammation reflect true virus-related pathology; other findings represent superimposed or unrelated processes."

                        data-abstract="The most important development in the epidemiology of periodontitis in the USA during the last decade is the result of improvements in survey methodologies and statistical modeling of periodontitis in adults. Most of these advancements have occurred as the direct outcome of work by the joint initiative known as the Periodontal Disease Surveillance Project by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Periodontology that was established in 2006. This report summarizes some of the key findings of this important initiative and its impact on our knowledge of the epidemiology of periodontitis in US adults. This initiative first suggested new periodontitis case definitions for surveillance in 2007 and revised them slightly in 2012. This classification is now regarded as the global standard for periodontitis surveillance and is used worldwide. First, application of such a standard in reporting finally enables results from different researchers in different countries to be meaningfully compared. Second, this initiative tackled the concern that prior national surveys, which used partial-mouth periodontal examination protocols, grossly underestimated the prevalence of periodontitis of potentially more than 50%. Consequently, because previous national surveys significantly underestimated the true prevalence of periodontitis, it is not possible to extrapolate any trend in periodontitis prevalence in the USA over time. Any difference calculated may not represent any actual change in periodontitis prevalence, but rather is a consequence of using different periodontal examination protocols. Finally, the initiative addressed the gap in the need for state and local data on periodontitis prevalence. Through the direct efforts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Periodontology initiative, full-mouth periodontal probing at six sites around all nonthird molar teeth was included in the 6 years of National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2009-2014, yielding complete data for 10 683 dentate community-dwelling US adults aged 30 to 79 years. Applying the 2012 periodontitis case definitions to the 2009-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys data, the periodontitis prevalence turned out to be much greater than previously estimated, namely affecting 42.2% of the population with 7.8% of people experiencing severe periodontitis. It was also discovered that only the moderate type of periodontitis is driving the increase in periodontitis prevalence with age, not the mild or the severe types whose prevalence do not increase consistently with age, but remain ~ 10%-15% in all age groups of 40 years and older. The greatest risk for having periodontitis of any type was seen in older people, in males, in minority race/ethnic groups, in poorer and less educated groups, and especially in cigarette smokers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Periodontology initiative reported, for the first time, the periodontitis prevalence estimated at both local and state levels, in addition to the national level. Also, this initiative developed and validated in field studies a set of eight items for self-reported periodontitis for use in direct survey estimates of periodontitis prevalence in existing state-based surveys. These items were also included in the 2009-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for validation against clinically determined cases of periodontitis. Another novel result of this initiative is that, for the first time, the geographic distribution of practicing periodontists in relation to the geographic distribution of people with severe periodontitis is illustrated. In summary, the precise periodontitis prevalence and distribution among subgroups in the dentate US noninstitutionalized population aged 30-79 years is better understood because of application of valid periodontitis case definitions to full-mouth periodontal examination, in combination with reliable information on demographic and health-related measures. We now can monitor the trend of periodontitis prevalence over time as well as guide public health preventive and intervention initiatives for the betterment of the health of the adult US population."

the benefits from both water and liquid scintillator (LS) in a single detector
so that low energy physics and rare event searches can have higher
sensitivities due to the larger size detector with increased light yield. No
experiment has ever used a WbLS technology since it still needs some R&amp;D
studies, as currently being performed by THEIA group. If this technology works
successfully with kiloton scale detector at Yemilab then it can be applied to

                        data-abstract="Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) succeeds the very successful Super-K experiment
and will consist of a large detector filled with 260~kton purified water and
equipped with 40\% photo-coverage. Physics program of Hyper-K is broad,
covering from particle physics to astrophysics and astronomy. The Hyper-K
1$^{st}$ detector will be built in Japan, and the 2$^{nd}$ detector is
considered to be built in Korea because locating the 2$^{nd}$ detector in Korea
improves physics sensitivities in most cases thanks to the longer baseline
($\sim$1,100~km) and larger overburden ($\sim$1,000~m) for Korean candidate
sites. In this talk, we present overview and physics potentials of the Hyper-K
2$^{nd}$ detector in Korea."

of a knowledge base of socio-economic systems. The &#39;knowledge infrastructure&#39;
is measured using multiple indicators: webometric, scientometric, and
technometric. The paper employs this triangulation strategy to examine the
current state of the innovation systems of South Korea and the Netherlands.
These indicators are thereafter used for the evaluation of the systemness in
configurations of university-industry-government relations. South Korea is
becoming somewhat stronger than the Netherlands in terms of scientific and
technological outputs and in terms of the knowledge-based dynamics; South
Korea&#39;s portfolio is more traditional than that of the Netherlands. For
example, research and patenting in the biomedical sector is underdeveloped. In
terms of the Internet-economy, the Netherlands seem oriented towards global
trends more than South Korea; this may be due to the high component of services
in the Dutch economy."

of the problem, a predicted population time series is calculated using the

Engel-Granger approach is applied to the difference of the measured and

Both tests show the existence of a cointegrating relation. The Johansen test
results in the cointegrating rank 1. Since a cointegrating relation between the
measured and predicted number of 9-year-olds does exist, the VAR, VECM, and
linear regression are used in estimation of the goodness of fit and root
mean-square errors, RMSE. The highest R2=0.95 and the best RMSE is obtained in

area and microsecond time resolution capable of conducting a broad program of
studies of galactic X-ray binaries. USA is one of nine experiments aboard the
Advanced Research and Global Observation Satellite which was launched February
23, 1999. USA is a collimated proportional counter X-ray telescope with about
1000 cm$^2$ of effective area per detector with two detectors sensitive to
photons in the energy range 1-15 keV. A unique feature of USA is that photon
events are time tagged by reference to an onboard GPS receiver allowing precise
absolute time and location determination. We will present an overview of the
USA instrument, capabilities, and scientific observing plan as well as the
current status of the instrument."

South Korea is one of a series of countries (ranging from Taiwan, India, Brazil, and Turkey, to Mexico, and including Japan) to have succeeded through borrowing foreign technology rather than by generating new products or processes. Describing such countries as `late-industrializers,&#39; Amsden demonstrates why South Korea has become the most successful of this group.
